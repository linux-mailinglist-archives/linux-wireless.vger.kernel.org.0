Is possible that this is rt2800usb or usb host driver issue. But without
full logs we can not be sure.

After that message there should be stack trace visible. To debug this
you would need to find a way to see the full logs (dmesg/kmsg) after the crash.
It can be serial console, netconsole, pstore or some other thing. Perhaps
your platform allow to boot debug kernel with various check, which will
not panic when the bug occures and will show useful info in the logs.

This actually suggest that the issue is somewhere in the core.
But again, without full logs we can not be sure.

The rt2800 driver wasn't modified for ages. It's rater stable, but
perhaps there are issues in other involved modules i.e. mac80211.
