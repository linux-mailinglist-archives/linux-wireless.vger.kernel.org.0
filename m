The proof of concept patch for v5.10-rc2 is here:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-wireless/patch/1605121102-14352-1-git-send-email-kvalo@codeaurora.org/

Hopefully it makes it possible to boot the firmware now. But this is a
quick hack and most likely buggy, so keep your expectations low :)

In case there are these warnings during firmware initialisation:

ath11k_pci 0000:05:00.0: qmi failed memory request, err = -110
ath11k_pci 0000:05:00.0: qmi failed to respond fw mem req:-110

Try reverting this commit:

7fef431be9c9 mm/page_alloc: place pages to tail in __free_pages_core()

That's another issue which is debugged here:
