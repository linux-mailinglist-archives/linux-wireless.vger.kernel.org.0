It's great that you suggested this since it's actually what also I've been 
started to think should be done instead of this straightforward approach
I used in V2. 

That is, don't have the drivers to get anything directly from LNKCTL
but they should get everything through the API provided by the 
disable/enable calls which makes it easy for the driver to pass the same
value back into the enable call.

Yes, it's what I've been thinking between the lines. But I see your point 
that this API didn't make it easy/obvious as is.

Would you want me to enforce it too besides altering the API such that the 
states are actually returned from disable call? (I don't personally find
that necessary as long as the API pair itself makes it obvious what the 
driver is expect to pass there.)
