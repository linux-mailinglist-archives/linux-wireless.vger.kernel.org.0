Hello,
 
My name is Yuval Rose, a Client Relations officer at one of 
Canada’s foremost Crypto-currency exchange platforms. This is a 
private and confidential message from me to you and I request 
that it be treated as such.
 
I am contacting you with respect to an urgent issue regarding a 
Bitcoin account belonging to a deceased account holder. The 
Bitcoin (500 BTC) which was valued at over 4.6 Million United 
States Dollars was sold and converted to cash at the request of 
the late account holder for onward deposit to an account to be 
advised by her. Upon liquidation, we waited for months for info 
on the bank account for the deposit but never got a feedback. 
Upon inquiry, it was confirmed that she passed away (died) after 
a cancer related ailment.
 
At a meeting held 2 weeks ago by my Company’s Management on the 
matter, it was resolved that unless a Next of Kin or any relative 
of the late account Holder comes forward for claim of the funds 
on or before 30th of December 2019 (which is practically 
impossible) the whole funds would be converted back to Bitcoin 
and becomes part of the Company's portfolio.
 
With the above in mind, I decided to quickly reach out to you so 
that you can apply to my company for claim of this fund in the 
capacity of a Next-of-Kin/Relative. Rest assured that this is a 
straight forward process with no risks involved whatsoever. Start 
to finish of the process with fund deposited in your nominated 
bank account can be achieved within a space of 10 banking days or 
less. All that I require from you is full cooperation and 
sincerity.
I will await your reply and indication of interest to give you 
further/complete details including sharing ratio.
 
Best Regards
 
Yuval
