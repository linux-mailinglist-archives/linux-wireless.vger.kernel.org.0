I think you mean device_add_class_symlinks(), but that's just for
class devices.  Of course, thermal devices are class devices, so
they'll get those links if they get parents.  Fair enough.

Let's set suspend aside for now, I think I've explained my viewpoint

No, I'm not.

Maybe let's take care of cooling devices first and get back to this later?
