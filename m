The skipping is already done for __dma_sync_single_for_device() in this
patch, but not for dma_unmap_page_attrs(), see the clearing of dma_sync
in page_pool_destroy().

As mentioned in commit log, attempting DMA unmaps after the driver has
already unbound may leak resources or at worst corrupt memory.
The skipping only avoid corrupting memory, but not leaking resources, as
there may be bounce buffer or iova resources before the dma mapping as my
understanding.

And when page_pool_destroy() is called, there is currently no way to
tell if the device is going to be invalid or not.

It depends on what your definition of fast path here, there are three
kinds of fast path for page pool as my understanding.

For the first and second fast path, the synchronization cost is the
rcu read lock overhead introduced in patch 1.

For the third fast path when we need to refill from or flush to the
page allocator, the added overhead is the page_pool_item_add() and
page_pool_item_del() calling as my understanding.

Will provide the performance data in the next version.

Does page_pool_item_uninit() need to handle 'netmem' case?

How does the devmem handle the case net_iov being cached in network stack
when the driver has already unbound? I am supposing there is a device for
dma_buf_unmap_attachment_unlocked(), and is it possible that the device
become invalid too when the driver has unbound? If yes, doesn't it have a
similar problem as the case of normal page?
