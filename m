I am not sure what dose the API that allows netdev to "give" struct device
to page_pool look like or how to implement the API yet, but the obvious way
to stall the calling of device_del() is to wait for the inflight page to
come back in page_pool_destroy(), which seems the same as the jakub's
way from the viewpoint of user, and jakub's way seems more elegant than
waiting in page_pool_destroy().

Yes.
The problem seems to be how long page_pool is allowed to stall the driver
unloading? Does the driver unload stalling affect some feature like device
hotplug?
As the problem in [1], the stall might be forever due to caching in the
network stack as discussed in [2], and there might be some other caching
we don't know yet.

The stalling log in [1] is caused by the caching in skb_attempt_defer_free(),
we may argue that a timeout is needed for those kind of caching, but Eric
seemed to think otherwise in commit log of [3]:
"As Eric pointed out/predicted there's no guarantee that
applications will read / close their sockets so a page pool page
may be stuck in a socket (but not leaked) forever."
