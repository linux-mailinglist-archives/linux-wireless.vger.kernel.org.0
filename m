That's because the wireless trees were on a summer break:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/87y1kncuh4.fsf@kernel.org/

> I can drop it from my tree.

Yes, please drop this. And in the future don't take any wireless patches
unless acked by Johannes or me, I want to minimize the risk of conflicts
between the trees. If a patch is missed for whatever reason please let
me know, do not take it to your tree.

> What's needed for it to be picked up through wireless?

I don't know why Felix didn't take this patch but now I assigned it to
me on patchwork:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-wireless/patch/20230703181256.3712079-1-azeemshaikh38@gmail.com/

It should be in wireless-next this week.
