Over the years we have been accumulating a number of patches improving
support for the IEEE 802.11bgn 2T2R wireless interface built into the
MediaTek MT7620 MIPS SoCs. Many of them have not been in shape for
being submitted to Linux and changes were needed to make checkpatch.pl
all happy (it is now). Now they look as good as it gets, given that
most code deals with undocumented registers and was adapted from the
vendor driver.

Patch 01/16 also has been previously submitted and then (imho wrongly)
rejected, so I've included it in this series with an updated commit
message.

Patch 02/16 also has been previously submitted but never received any
feedback. I've also included it here again because having a more
informative LED trigger is definitely an improvement.

Alltogether rt2x00 now performs almost as good as the vendor driver,
see benchmark of HT20 client below:
