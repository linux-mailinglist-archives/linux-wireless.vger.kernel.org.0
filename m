That is correct. What has been done there, and in the equivalent rtw88-usb 
version, is replace the PCI I/O calls with the equivalent USB library calls. 
What cannot be determined outside the Realtek halls is whether there are changes 
in the NIC chip itself between the two versions. Certainly, there are 
differences between the setup of the rtl8192ce and the rtl8192cu. I would expect 
the same here.

Not really. That hardware is wifi4 (802.11n) and has no higher capabilities. The 
basic silicon and firmware could not handle the higher protocols.

Perhaps. That will depend on the PCI group from Realtek deciding to tackle that 
project.
