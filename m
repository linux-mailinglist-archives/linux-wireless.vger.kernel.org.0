I generally agree with this email, especially that Arend should stay
on as a reviewer/maintainer.

We need more people as either maintainers/contributors/reviewers/code
writers/testers, not less, to delegate, co-maintain, test, merge, make
the code more portable to many wifi devices, etc.

What really matters at the end of the day I guess is writing the code
that works across all the devices and testing it.

Which is why I spread awareness about this area, got 100s of
responses, especially on Linkedin, there's at least a portion of these
that want to help, in good spirits.

Is mise le meas/Regards,
