I guess you mean the amdgpu, radeon, and hfi1 drivers.  They really
shouldn't be mucking with that stuff anyway.  But they do and are
unlikely to change because we don't have any good alternative.

One way around that would be to add some quirk code to
pcie_capability_write_word().  Ugly, but we do have something sort of
similar in pcie_capability_read_word() already.
