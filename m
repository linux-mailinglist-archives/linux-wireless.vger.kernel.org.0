that's interesting. Can you confirm that you are using the 40 MHz 
frequency range?
My AP is an AVM FritzBox!3390. In its menu I can see that the wifi 
dongle is using the following configuration: 2.4 GHz, n, 40 MHz, WPA2, 1 
x 1
With the one antenna of the rtl8188eu and 40 MHz the theoretical limit 
is 150 Mbps.

I also retested with a local iperf server on the fritzbox.
This is where things get strange. With the new r8188eu driver iperf over 
TCP gives me ~60 Mbps.
While google's speedtest still gives me only ~30 Mbps (I also tested 
various other in-browser tests with same results).
With the old driver rtl8188eu again I get ~95 Mbps over iperf and 
in-browser.

Regards,
Daniel
