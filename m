That is more complicated than I assumed. Even the "generic" hal layer is
different. Sometimes there are additional bits, sometimes the bits are
moved (to/from the HW-specific hal layer), sometimes the bits the are
different (like BIT0|BIT1 vs BIT1). Without having any kind of
documentation I can't even tell how essential the difference is.

Right now I went function by function and compared the code and *hoped*
that I didn't miss anything. I get USB errors later and I can't tell if
there is something that I missed/did wrong _or_ did not yet modify. I'm
worried that by the time I'm done, I did something wrong and no idea
where to look for the bug.

I stumbled over the version define:
The driver on github is
|include/rtw_version.h:#define DRIVERVERSION "v5.2.2.4_25483.20171222"

and mine is
|include/rtw_version.h:#define DRIVERVERSION "v5.7.4_33085.20190419"

Going by the date, they are more than a year apart. (Side note: the
driver in staging is from 2013.)

Is it possible to obtain a more recent version of the 8188EU driver from
realtek? That should ease the integration of the "two" drivers since the
generic bits should be the sameâ€¦

What would be the challenges to get the 8188f Realtek driver upstream?
Looking at the todo list for the staging driver, it is mostly clean up
and checkpatch kind of thing. The more difficult/non mechanic task is to
convince the driver to use lib80211/mac80211 layer.
