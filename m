Well it was kind of documented  originally as host byte order, but
(some) drivers historically did big endian ...

Anyway, same thing - but note it's only doing the big endian check for a
single value.

Yeah it's confusing ...

Well the firmware cannot support arbitrary AKM here, I'd think? And
anyway it's not even sent to the firmware at all, so it has to be
assuming it's SAE or so?

Well it's more a question of what the firmware will actually be able to
do here, I'd think. IIUC the whole point of this is to let firmware know
what it's expected to do.

If we were to drop support for old wpa_supplicant, then no, we could
just use host byte order everywhere.

As we want to continue supporting old wpa_supplicant, which really just
checked for RSN_AUTH_KEY_MGMT_SAE in big endian (before [3], when it
started checking for both big endian and host byte order), then we have
to send *that particular value* in big endian. For every other value we
have to send it in host byte order, because either it doesn't matter
(old wpa_s) or is checked in host byte order (new wpa_s, after later
patches to this code checking for other values.)

But! That actually also means the driver is wrong now, because it sends
_any_ value back in big endian, when wpa_s - new or old - only checks
for this one value in big endian. It's OK with old since it only checks
for this value in the first place, but broken for new!

Well you could do the exact same thing in the driver.

But it's probably cleaner to handle the backward compat issue in nl80211
and let the driver(s) just use host byte order generally, as intended?

I'm happy with that, sure. Please do check.
