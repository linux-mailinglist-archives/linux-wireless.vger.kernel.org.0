> 1. Without host mlme, management packet filter of AP mode is the same as client mode. Authentication/Association packets are handled by firmware and once if station is connected, firmware will send station connection event to driver. So you can still start wpa_supplicant and hostapd on uap0 at same time. However, this is not correct setting and usage.

That explains the difference in behavior, thank you!
