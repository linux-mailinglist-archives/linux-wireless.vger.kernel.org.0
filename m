Hi,

we've got a report about the regression with the latest iwlwifi 9260
*-46.ucode that landed recently in linux-firmware tree.  WiFi doesn't
work any longer on some Dell machines with that firmware.  See details
in:
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1142128

Currently we're reverting to the previously released firmware files.

Is it a known problem that has been already addressed?
If not, shall we revert the changes as a tentative workaround?


Thanks!

Takashi
