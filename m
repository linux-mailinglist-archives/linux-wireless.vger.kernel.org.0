I've spent a little more time looking at this. I think the issue is that
the regulatory rules are only used to establish channel definititions
for 20 MHz channels, and these channel definitions are what get used
when establishing tx parameters. While the flags are checked against the
chandefs of secondary channels, only the primary channel's power limits
are used for tx power. So I think the behavior of the kernel is incorect
here.

However, I think the regulatory database should reflect the regulatory
data as accurately as possible, so I'd prefer we not split out 5210-5230
and try to get the bug fixed in the kernel.

Thanks,
Seth
