A cause of interoperability problem could be due to PCI bridge side
configured by BIOS. We have fixed this kind of problem many times before.
Maybe, this device has less tolerance to handle PCI signals. The module
parameter is an alternative way to help users to resolve the problem in
their platforms. If people buy a computer with this device built-in, he
will meet this problem in low probability because ODM will verify this
ahead. If people buy this device themselves to install to their platforms,
it is hard to guarantee it can work well, because cause of interoperability
could be bride side as mentioned in beginning.

Normally, users don't need to specify this module parameter. If it's really
needed, we can add a quirk along with DMI vendor and product name to configure
automatically. But, indeed we still need a user to try that module parameter
can work on a certain platform.

In fact, we only don't suggest to change L1SS "dynamically". Initially,
enable or disable L1SS is usable, and driver will set chip-specific 
setting along with standard PCI configuration.

So, I think it would be okay to have a quirk that "never change L1SS dynamically".
But, I'm not sure if switching L1SS is a common option for average users?
I mean L1SS normally is configured by developers only, so restrictions aren't
always good to them, because they should know what they are doing.
