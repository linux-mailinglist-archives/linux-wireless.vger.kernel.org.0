Hi all,

I can confirm the issue as I'm also seeing this sometimes in the field here.

Sometimes when a devices goes out of range and then re-enters,
the link refuses to "come up", as in rx looks to be "stuck" without any 
reports in system log or locking issues (lockdep enabled)

I have dozens of devices installed offshore (802.11n based), both on 
static and moving assets,
which cover from short (250m) up to very long distances (~35km)

So .. while there is some momentum for this issue,
I'm more than happy to provide extensive testing should fixes be posted 
regarding IBSS in general.

Regards,

Koen
