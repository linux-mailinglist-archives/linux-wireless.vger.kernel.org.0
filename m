Right. But ideally, they should also be converted to use this power sequencing
driver at some point in the future.

I don't think it is necessary to add PM support in this series itself. Even
though PM support is always nice to have or even necessary for controllers
pulling the power plug during suspend, it makes sense to merge this basic
implementation and add features on top.

It should be noted that both the controller drivers and the power sequencing
drivers should be in sync during suspend i.e., if the controller driver decides
to put the device into D3Cold and turning off the controller power supplies,
then this driver should also power off the device. But if the controller driver
decides to keep the device in low power states (ASPM), then this driver
_should_not_ turn off the device power.

Right now, there is no global policy for controller drivers and each one does a
different job. IMO this should also be fixed, but that also requires an
agreement from PM folks.

(Well there is one more entity in this loop, PCIe device drivers... sigh)

Yeah. And that "generic" driver could be used for simple usecases mentioned
above.

Precisely!
