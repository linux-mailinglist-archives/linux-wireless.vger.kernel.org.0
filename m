Greetings to you and your family.

With all due respect I got your details from an online directory and
having  been motivated by your personal status, I decided to approach
you  I am
Mrs. Assana Ibrahim; I have decided to donate what I have to you /
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and
diagnosed
for cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God Almighty
to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for
good work
of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to forgive me and believe
he has, because he is a Merciful God I will be going in for an
operation
surgery soon.

I decided to will/donate the sum of ($ 8.1 million DOLLARS) to you for
the good work of God Almighty, and also to help the motherless and
less
privilege and also forth assistance of the widows. At the moment I
cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my
relatives (that
have squandered the funds gave them for this purpose before) are
around me and my health status also. I have adjusted my will and my
lawyer is aware.

I wish you all the best and May the good Lord bless you abundantly,
and please use the funds judiciously and always extend the good work
to others.
As soon as you get back to me, I shall give you info on what I need
from you, then you will contact the bank and tell them I have willed
those
properties to you by quoting my personal file routing and account
information. And I have also notified the bank that I am willing that
properties to you for a good, effective and prudent work. I know I
don't know you but I have been directed to do this by God Almighty.

I Have all my Hospital document which i can send to you as prove to
what am tell you and my seriousness to this. If you are interested in
carrying out
this task, get back to me for more details on this noble project of mine.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Assana Ibrahim
