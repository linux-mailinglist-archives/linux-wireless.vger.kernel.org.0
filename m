I find the rules in GSR No. 45(E) unclear and a little confusing.
Broadly you can think of EIRP(dBm) = tx_output_power(dBm) +
antenna_gain(dBi). If you look at the US rules [1] you can see that it
specifies EIRP assuming an antenna gain of 6 dBi or less, with
adjusments for antennas with larger gains.

GSR No. 45(E) does not define things as clearly, but when I see a
transmitter output power of 30 dBm and a maximum effective radiated
power of 36 dBm it leads me to think that it has a similar model of
assuming an antenna gain <= 6 dBi. I could be wrong, but from what I see
this interpretation makes the most sense to me.

30 dBm is certainly a safe value though, as the max EIRP should be at
least that much under any interpretation.
