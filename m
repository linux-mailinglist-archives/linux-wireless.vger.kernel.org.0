Thanks for the thorough report. By my calculations that's the third user
report about ipw2x00 so clearly there are users still and we shouldn't
remove the driver. I'm dropping this patch 10 from my queue now.

It would be great if you could cleanup the driver and convert it to use
mac80211. In the wiki link below there is more info how to contribute
patches to the wireless subsystem. I always recommend starting with
something small and going towards more complex patches with baby steps.
Avoid patchbombing as much as possible!

For example, I see lots of dead code under '#ifdef NOT_YET' and '#if 0',
removing those is a good a start. Also converting the ugly debug_level
procfs file to something more modern would be nice, maybe using just
dev_dbg() throught the driver is a good option? Or maybe use a module
parameter instead?
