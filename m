It took a while to figure out what it is doing, yes... and while figuring
it out, I found more and more to cleanup... And seems you also found some
more... ;-) lol.

When going all the way with cleanups, I tend run this kind of things that 
are not all that obvious but those are usually the most valuable cleanups 
(and normally cannot be automated either so we'll have a lot less people 
looking at them).

Good point, I forgot to change that in 2/7 and it belongs logically into 
this patch anyway so I'll add it to this patch.

It's what I inferred based on the offsets of LNKCTL & DEVCTL2. And if 
that assumption does not hold with all these devices, the writes would 
just wreck some random havoc. :-/

I thought of adding the masking here too but since it wasn't strictly 
necessary, I didn't. But I can add that now and I'll also update the 
comment to match the code :-).

These code fragments hopefully die anyway once I get the ASPM from 
drivers to core series done.

Oh no, I entirely missed it because of those nice comments which tell it's 
trying to update bridge's ASPM so I didn't pay attention to which device 
it passes for real...

Now I'm left to wonder what would be the best course of action here...
Since it has never really written to bridge's ASPM at all, perhaps that's 
not needed and those writes could just be dropped rather than point them 
to the correct device.

I thought of that but since it was just 2 extra context blocks which are 
clearly disjoint from the rest, I didn't separate the removal of the 
member variable to its own patch.
