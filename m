Good evening all!  Just wanted to follow up as I think I've started to
uncover some of what's happening with the XPS and this driver.  So
since I can't get the kdump kernel to dump anything for me, I took a
bit more of a naive approach.  I blacklisted the modules (ath11k /
ath11k_pci) from modprobe so I could at least control when it was
loaded.  I managed to capture a series of crashes (in phone pics, but
I'll transcribe the relevant bits here) that seem to indicate some
kind of runaway / spin locked behavior.  In all but one case[*], both
the crash and the eventual working state, the driver completely
initialized successfully with messaging like this:

[   23.677675] ath11k_pci 0000:55:00.0 wlp85s0: renamed from wlan0

So up until this point, everything is working without issues.
Everything seems to spiral out of control a couple of seconds later
when my system attempts to actually bring up the adapter.  In most of
the crash states I will see this:

[   31.286725] wlp85s0: send auth to ec:08:6b:27:01:ea (try 1/3)
[   31.390187] wlp85s0: send auth to ec:08:6b:27:01:ea (try 2/3)
[   31.391928] wlp85s0: authenticated
[   31.394196] wlp85s0: associate with ec:08:6b:27:01:ea (try 1/3)

[   31.407730] wlp85s0: associated
[   31.434354] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): wlp85s0: link becomes ready

And then either somewhere in that pile of messages, or a second or two
after this my machine will start to stutter as I mentioned before, and
then it either hangs, or I see this message (I'm truncating the
timestamp):

[   35.xxxx ] sched: RT throttling activated

After that moment, the machine is unresponsive.  Sorry I can't seem to
extract this data other than screenshots from my phone at the moment,
you can see the dmesg output from 6 different hangs here:
https://github.com/w1nk/ath11k-debug

* - In the case where the driver didn't fully initialize successfully
and hung; during the initialization right after the "MSI vectors: %d"
printk, I started seeing these:

[ 77.xxx ] alloc_contig_range: [88d8e0, 88d8e9) PFNs busy
