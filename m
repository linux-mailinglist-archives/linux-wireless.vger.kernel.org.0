I think it'd make sense to put this in a topic branch.

I discovered this in the process of developing [1] (which could use an
Ack for the wake_up_state EXPORT_SYMBOL, by the way). That's marked
for stable@ because the breakage there is kind of bad -- people can't put
their laptops to sleep right now. After both this patch and that one
land, I may then revisit the ath9k one and make changes for non-stable@.
That is, of course, if [1] even lands; right now I fear it might be
relegated to scheduler bikeshed purgatory and I don't have the time
right now to deal with that.

Longer term, this patch here will let me rework [1] to get rid of the
set_notify_signal() trick and use a proper condition variable wait with
`wait_for_condition_interruptible_timeout`, since this patch makes that
function work right for both contexts in which hwrng devices are called
(kthread and process). But that will mean reworking the hwrng API, which
means writing patches for every single hwrng driver, so that's work for
another time.

In the mean time, [1] is a good way forward (provided it gets acked).
And then this patch puts things in a good position to improve down the
line. I did a bunch of testing of this patch when trying out different
candidates for [1] before settling on [1] as a good-enough intermediate
solution. 

So, anyway, feel free to put this in a topic branch.

Jason
