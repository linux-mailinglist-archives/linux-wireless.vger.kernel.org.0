Hi all,

Not my wheelhouse...  and I've not read through the WiFi 6 Certified Location service specification, but does anyone have an idea of what would be required to support this in out-of-the-box Linux?

Per this news release:

https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-certified-location-brings-wi-fi-indoor-positioning-capabilities

> Wi-Fi Locationâ„¢, based on the Fine Timing Measurement (FTM) protocol from IEEE 802.11-2016, delivers meter-level accuracy for indoor device location data.

Looking in include/linux/ieee80211.h I see:

include/linux/ieee80211.h:	WLAN_PUB_ACTION_FTM_REQUEST = 32,
include/linux/ieee80211.h:	WLAN_PUB_ACTION_FTM = 33,

But these don't appear anywhere else in the tree.

It also states:

> Each AP in a Wi-Fi Location network is configured with its exact location, including geospatial coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude), and civic address. This allows more precise location determination than with other solutions, even in multilevel structures.

But doesn't specify how that location is exchanged with the client.

Is anyone in the Linux kernel community working on an FTM implementation?

Thanks
