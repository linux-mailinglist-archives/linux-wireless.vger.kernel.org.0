Thanks.  Sending updated version as replies to the original series
posting makes it hard to keep track of what's happening.  Better if
you send a "v2" series of *all* the patches, even if some of them
haven't changed.  There are a few hints here, although it's not very
explicit:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst?id=v6.1#n633

Also, you use multiple email addresses, and if you can figure out how
to at least make the display names the same, it will make the
conversation easier to follow.  Here's what it looks like in mutt:

  - Jan  7  9:14 Mad Horse       [PATCH] pci: Add functions ...
  - Jan 10  9:24 To Mad Horse    ├─>

  - Jan 17 13:46 To Edward Chow    └─>
  - Jan 31 21:02 Mad Horse           └─>

This also shows the problem with updated versions in the same thread.
I can work out that "Jan 17 1/3", "Jan 21 2/3", and "Jan 21 3/3" are
supposed to be the newest versions, but tools like patchwork and b4
are not smart enough to do that, so it's really hard to apply this.

If you just post an updated series, e.g.,

  [PATCH v2 0/3] PCI: ...
  |-> [PATCH v2 1/3] PCI: of: Match ...
  |-> [PATCH v2 1/3] PCI: of: Match ...
  |-> [PATCH v2 1/3] PCI: of: Match ...

then everything will be nice and clean and easy to review and apply.

Bjorn
