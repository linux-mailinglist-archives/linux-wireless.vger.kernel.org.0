Hello!

Qualcomm has already sent following statement to media:

    Qualcomm has already made mitigations available to OEMs in May 2020,
    and we encourage end users to update their devices as patches have
    become available from OEMs.

And based on information from ESET blog post, Qualcomm's proprietary
driver for these wifi cards is fixed since Qualcomm July release.

Could somebody react and provide some details when fixes would be
available for ath9k and ath10k Linux drivers? And what is current state
of this issue for Linux?

I'm looking at ath9k and ath10k git trees [1] [2] [3] and I do not see
there any change which could be related to CVE-2020-3702.

Based on ESET tests, wifi cards which use ath9k driver (opensource, not
that Qualcomm proprietary) are still vulnerable.
