Well, that's not how Linus wants things to be, as due to this "no
regression" rule things should continue to work if people update the
kernel without updating linux-firmware (as also explained in
Documentation/driver-api/firmware/firmware-usage-guidelines.rst).

That's what I though when I saw that message initially, but I thought:
well, not worth a comment, the reporter apparently doesn't mind that
much. But since then I saw more and more reports that looked related to
my untrained eyes (and thus might not be related at all!).

Gregory, Johannes, is there something wrong here with 6.5.y? If yes: is
anything already been done to improve the state of things?
