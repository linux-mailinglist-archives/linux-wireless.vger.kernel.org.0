Ok, so I took another look at the strace and you are right.

There are 2 things happening here:

1. g-s-d has a private rfkill.h userspace-api copy with the old 8 byte
   rfkill_event definition, which I missed.

2. g-s-d mixes read() and g_io_channel_read_chars() usage, using
   read() to get the initial state and then later on using
   g_io_channel_read_chars() on events. The initial state read()s
   are the read(fd, buf, 8) calls which I saw in the strace.

So g-s-d was using / assuming a 8 byte struct size all the time and
my off-by-one by using buffered io theory was right, but works
differently then I expected. As you (Johannes) said, the problem is
g-s-d making read(fd, buf, 1024) calls, reading 9 bytes per event
and then returning 8 to the g_io_channel_read_chars() saving the
left over byte and pre-pending it to the next event, ruining
the next event(s).

Actually the code for getting the initial state seems to do the same
sizeof / RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1 mix/match as systemd is doing
(probably copy and pasted from one to the other), but it is "saved"
somewhat by having its own rfkill.h copy:

                len = read(fd, &event, sizeof(event));
                if (len < 0) {
                        if (errno == EAGAIN)
                                break;
                        g_debug ("Reading of RFKILL events failed");
                        break;
                }

                if (len != RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1) {
                        g_warning ("Wrong size of RFKILL event\n");
                        continue;
                }

And then later on, when poll says there is new data:

                status = g_io_channel_read_chars (source,
                                                  (char *) &event,
                                                  sizeof(event),
                                                  &read,
                                                  NULL);

                while (status == G_IO_STATUS_NORMAL && read == sizeof(event)) {

So with my fix to turn off buffering all should be well now, but we
(g-s-d folks) should consider doing a follow-up patch to

plugins/rfkill/rfkill-glib.c

Replacing all the sizeof(event) occurences with RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1 for
future proofing against rfkill.h changes (e.g. if someone syncs
the private copy with the kernel) although this should be safe with
the recent kernel-header change...

Benjamin, what is your take on doing a  s/sizeof(event)/RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1/ ?

At a minimum that would be good to do because it fixes this weirdness:

                len = read(fd, &event, sizeof(event));
                if (len < 0) {
                        if (errno == EAGAIN)
                                break;
                        g_debug ("Reading of RFKILL events failed");
                        break;
                }

                if (len != RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1) {
                        g_warning ("Wrong size of RFKILL event\n");
                        continue;
                }

Where the len param passed to read() and the one checked for are
not necessarily the same.

Regards,

Hans
