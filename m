So it seems there's 2 possible sticking points: code duplication, and
overall trend in the specs and implementation that might increase
duplication?

To me, it seems like the duplication is minimal today, or at least, not
much as a result of anything in this patch proposal. There's some
repetition of 802.11 definitions already, but that's probably
orthogonal.

I have less understanding and foresight on the "trend" questions,
although David seems to somewhat agree in his response below -- that NXP
intends to handle modern security features in the host more and more,
which could indeed mean a bit more framing-related duplication.

David, I may have pointed in the wrong direction by claiming "conflict"
with mac80211. I believe Johannes's concerns are in code duplication.
Pretty much all other actively-maintained Linux WiFi drivers are based
on mac80211, so that we don't all have to implement the same frame
construction and parsing code. mwifiex is somewhat of an outlier in
actively adding new features while remaining a cfg80211-only driver.

But for myself, I'm not even fully convinced mac80211-style stuff makes
sense here. Even just looking at the auth() stuff in patch 1, this
driver is far from a thin layer that allows mac80211 to handle the
802.11 details. Just look at the 'priv->host_mlme_reg' and
HostCmd_CMD_MGMT_FRAME_REG stuff -- it seems that the simple act of
sending a single 802.11 frame requires opting into some FW-specific
command mask. This feels "thick", like David mentioned above.

Yeah, I feel like I see hints of stuff (in public driver code, and in
internal discussions with vendors) where things really work best in
mac80211 land if firmware is developed with *some* consideration for the
mac80211 Linux architecture (or else already is a very thin firmware
from the start). I don't feel like Marvell/NXP has that consideration at
all, and so trying to drag its firmware into mac80211 regardless would
bring its own unique pain. But that's just a lightly-educated feeling.

David, repeating the "carefully verified" stuff doesn't really help the
subject at hand, and it's not really a technical argument either, when
it's not accompanied by any proofs. Being careful and running a good QA
cycle are excellent and appreciated, but that's not what we're talking
about any more. We're trying to understand what the firmware
architecture is like, and what driver architecture matches your future
development best, with the needs of the Linux community in mind.

(Now, as an example useful argument: if you claimed that implementing a
mac80211 driver with a generalized ieee80211_ops::tx() function would
introduce unvetted combinations of control logic that cannot be
reconciled with your HostCmd protocols, or that QA can't properly vet
that ... well, that would be a start of a technical argument. But it
would require more than a sentence or two to describe why that's
impossible or difficult.)

All in all, other than being a little grumpy about reviewing new
features here, I'm still leaning toward David's statement here -- that I
don't see why it *must* be rewritten toward mac80211. But I still defer
to Johannes, and I'm just trying to be a bit of a referee, or the
proverbial "devil's advocate".
