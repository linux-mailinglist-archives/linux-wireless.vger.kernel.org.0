Yay. But still, I think in this case it wouldn't help.

Wait, that's weird? The (latest) gio code just calls
g_io_channel_fill_buffer() and that doesn't care about the size you
passed to g_io_channel_read_chars(), in fact it isn't even passed down,
as you might expect for stream reads?

I understand the issue. I just didn't expect it would get solved when
the headers contain a struct rkfill_event of size 8 again, since the
kernel would still return 9 bytes. In effect, you'd still get the same
issue, because the read in g_io_channel_fill_buffer() is 1024
(G_IO_NICE_BUF_SIZE).

I agree, but ... kernel regressions and all that, right?

I don't think this is related to gio, you can still use
g_io_channel_read_chars() since that just does the read for you:

  if (!channel->use_buffer)
    {
      gsize tmp_bytes;

      g_assert (!channel->read_buf || channel->read_buf->len == 0);

      status = channel->funcs->io_read (channel, buf, count, &tmp_bytes, error);

      if (bytes_read)
        *bytes_read = tmp_bytes;

      return status;
    }


but checking that you actually got the *exact* size that you wanted is
indeed wrong (as well).

Sounds like I made the wrong call here - I was discussing this with
Benjamin a while ago and decided *not* to add an ioctl to opt in to the
new event type ... sounds like I should have.


Notice that the problem which I described there will go away when compiled
against even newer kernel-headers where sizeof(struct rfkill_event) is
back to 8 again.

Yes.

So question, for code like g-s-d, which does not care about the new
hard_block_reasons field. What would be the preferred / max compatibility
way to do the reads. Also keeping in mind that there are "bad" kernel
headers out there where sizeof(struct rfkill_event) == 9 ?

I think that this would be best:

	ret = read(fd, &event, RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1);
	if (ret == RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1) {
		/* Valid event process it */
	}

This should produce the same code regardless of the kernel-headers version
and should work on both old and new kernels, correct ?


I believe so, yes.

I don't think that rolling back the new extended-event support altogether
will help. Since this has been out there for 2 released kernel versions
now, I believe the best way to fix this is to fix userspace; and to fix
userspace in such a way (at least g-s-d) that this problem cannot
happen again.

Fair enough.

Thanks,
johannes
