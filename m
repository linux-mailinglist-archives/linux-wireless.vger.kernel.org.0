Now I'm looking at that security bulletin for CVE-2020-3702 and it
contains different list of affected chipset as at time when I wrote
previous email. Previously there were IPQ ath10k chipsets and no AR
chipsets. Now there are lot of ath9k AR9xxx and none of IPQ.

So meanwhile Qualcomm changed vulnerability list.
