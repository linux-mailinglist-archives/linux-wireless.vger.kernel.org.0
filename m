Currently kernel-doc raises "warning: bad line:" for several comments
that have invalid multi-line comment style; they are missing the
leading '*'. And checkpatch.pl raises "WARNING: please, no space
before tabs" for a large number of comments which have space then tab
after the leading '*'.

Fix those issues.
