iPA/iLNA the most commonly found combination in cheap devices.
iPA/eLNA is more rare, but found in some higher-quality devices.
ePA/eLNA is available mostly in markets which allow higher TX power.
ePA/iLNA haven't seen it yet, but theoretically possible.

Looking at the internal photos of Nexx WT3020, I'm very certain this
is an iPA/iLNA device -- apart from regulators, magnetics, MT7620N
itself and flash memory, another magnetics and RAM on the backside,
there are no other parts on the board. Also afaik MT7620N only supports
iLNA/iPA (due to the limited number of pins of the DRQFN package).
