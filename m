As far as the stack and kernel are concerned, it gets stuck in the
custom regulatory domain ('99') and sets the max power levels,
bandwidth caps, etc in the capabilities to match.

If you look at the phy info, it will clearly show you this.
You are correct that the chip maintains its own view of power levels
(though most drivers set them, we do not), but the bandwidth caps are
respected, for example.
Note also that '00' is recognized by at least this firmware, though I
agree it depends on whether/what is done in the CLM blob.

All that said, even if it changed nothing in the chip itself, it would
still be displaying completely wrong info to the user.
I'm happy to update the description if that is your main concern.
