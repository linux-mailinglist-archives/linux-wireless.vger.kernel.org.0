Ok, I've tried a clean checkout of 5.10-rc2 with the one MSI patch
applied and 7fef431be9c9 reverted.  I can't get my machine to  boot
into anything usable with that configuration.  I'm running ubuntu so
its starting right into X and sometime between showing the available
users and me clicking the icon to login the machine freezes.  I can
see in the system tray that the wifi adapter is being activated and
appears to have associated with an AP, I just can't do much beyond
that as the keyboard backlight wakes up, but the caps lock key doesn't
work.  I see similar behavior with the 5.9 configuration, but after a
reboot or two I win whatever race is occuring.  With 5.10, I tried
maybe 10-15 times with 0 success.
