PS: As this commit mentioned bt_coex_active, I retried with a
vanilla 5.9.6 kernel while leaving bt_coex_active at its
default value. That is leaving it enabled while all previous tests
I did had it disabled.

However I still get the Bluetooth A2DP freeze and subsequent
kernel panics.

Only the warnings in dmesg with
"iwlmvm doesn't allow to disable BT Coex, check bt_coex_active module parameter"
seem to have vanished.


Also, swcrypto is disabled, as it is by default. So the majority
of the lines changed shouldn't affect me.

The only thing that should affect and trigger the crashes for me
seems to be that BT_COEX_NW is now always enabled and that the code
now ignores what I set for the iwlwifi bt_coex_active module parameter.
While before I had it always disabled via the iwlwifi module parameter.
