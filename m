My point of view would definitely be that drivers in the mainline kernel
absolutely should respect the ABI defined in the dt-binding. What a vendor
decides to do in their own tree I suppose is their problem, but I would
advocate that vendor kernels would also respect the ABI from mainline.

Looking a bit more closely at the porting guide, it contains other
properties that are not present in the dt-binding - undocumented
compatibles and a different enable gpio property for example.
I guess it (and the vendor version of the driver) never got updated when
wilc1000 supported landed in mainline?

=46rom a dt-bindings point of view, the aforementioned revert seems
correct and would be
Acked-by: Conor Dooley <conor.dooley@microchip.com>

Getting off my dt-binding maintainer high-horse, linux4microchip is going
be updating to a 6.6 based kernel in the coming weeks - maybe that's a
good time to update the vendor kernel wilc drivers (and therefore the
porting guide?) to match the properties used by mainline Ajay?

Cheers,
Conor.
