So apart from the useless code (checking "ext_capa" twice, unnecessary
nested ifs, unnecessary parentheses), this can already be done entirely
by userspace, since it controls the ext capa we send.

This code here seems possibly wrong anyway since it doesn't take local
capabilities into account, maybe it should, and then these changes
wouldn't be necessary?

Wait, we actually have TWT capability *twice*, once in HE and once in
extended capabilities?! Fun.

But for this shouldn't we have the more general "HE capability override"
stuff that we have also for HT and VHT?
