WCN6855 & QCN9074 share the same driver code base since both being PCIe 
devices. One working and another not working seems to be surprising. Do 
you have a dmesg log when this problem occurred?

We are working on to root cause the original problem. The hindrance as 
of today is that we are not able to repro this so far in Qualcomm. We 
are planning to work with the reporter to get more logs.
