Oh, perfect.  Then I guess all we need is to restrict these devices to
2.5 GT/s.  And we can just ignore all my rambling about higher speeds
below, so I'll elide them.

The fact that the link came up automatically without any firmware or
software at all is very interesting.  The retrain path is actually
different from a hardware point of view: the power-on path through
LTSSM would normally be Detect, Polling, Configuration, L0; the
retrain path would be L0, Recovery, L0.  So I guess it isn't *too*
surprising that the power-on path could work even if the retrain path
is broken.

I wonder if setting, then clearing, the bridge's Link Disable bit
would work, since that would start again with the LTSSM Detect state,
just like power-on.  But I don't think that would help with this
ASPM/Common Clock issue because I think the link disable would look
like a hot reset to the endpoint, and it would clear the Common Clock
Configuration bit.

So backing up a loooong ways, how much value is there in doing this
retrain at all?  AFAICT the only reason we do it is because we think
the Common Clock Configuration is inconsistent, and we tried to fix
something, and we have to retrain the link to get the devices to
update their L0s and L1 exit latencies.  I guess it's the Slock Clock
(PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_SLC) bits that determines all this, right?  Do you
know those?

I wonder if this could be restructured as a generic quirk in quirks.c
that simply set the bridge's TLS to 2.5 GT/s during enumeration.  Or
would the retrain fail even in that case?

Ugh.  So this depends on the fact that pcie_capability_read_dword()
sets "*val = 0" if PCI_EXP_LNKCAP2 is not implemented.  I have a
half-baked idea that we should be doing "*val = ~0" instead because
that's what we normally get for *hardware* registers that are
implemented.

Based on PCIe r5.0, sec 4.2.6, when the link is trained, both devices
start at 2.5 GT/s.  Then they exchange TS Ordered Sets, which
advertise all the data rates supported by each side.  After the link
is operating in L0 at 2.5 GT/s, either side can initiate a change to
the highest supported common data rate.

A device can't initiate a change until it knows the rates supported by
both sides.  So either:

  - The bridge initiated a change because it knows *it* supports a
    higher rate and the Atheros device incorrectly advertised a higher
    rate), or 

  - The Atheros device initiated a change because the bridge
    advertised a higher rate and the Atheros device incorrectly thinks
    that *it* supports a higher rate.

Setting Target Link Speed in the bridge should prevent either case
because it restricts the rates advertised by the bridge in its
training sequences (per sec 7.5.3.19).

Interesting -- also per 7.5.3.19, Target Link Speed is permitted to
have no effect for Upstream Ports (like the one in the Atheros
device).  Probably makes sense since that port is not reachable until
the link is already operating.

Bottom line, I think you do have to do this with the bridge, not the
Atheros device.
