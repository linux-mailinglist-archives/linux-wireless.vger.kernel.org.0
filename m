Of course we're happy to do that. If this change goes in and we get an
actual report of breakage from someone, we'll have learned some very
valuable information: That there is, in fact, an end-user use case
(hardware/firmware/AP setting combination) where this code functions and
matters, and perhaps we'll have found someone willing to test things in
the future. Then we revert and rework the patch to keep the old code
path alive in that case.

The report will also give us valuable information about how to condition
it, because e.g. right now we don't even know if the sae_password code
works on any Cypress chips/firmwares at all, or conversely whether the
new WSEC code rather makes things work on some subset of Cypress
chips/firmwares instead. It is largely a mystery to everyone outside of
Broadcom and Cypress how that whole corporate division fork worked and
when and how the firmwares started diverging (never mind how Apple's
Broadcom firmwares may themselves differ).

It's the "don't touch it just in case" approach that is not sustainable,
because then we'll just be accumulating technical debt without the
slightest clue whether it even does anything useful or not, and
needlessly setting back development on the other and newer chips.

All this would, of course, be much easier if the vendor actually replied
to our emails, since evidently they know what chips/firmware branches
might have support for this, but even before Cypress names got removed
from MAINTAINERS I was already getting radio silence from them when I
asked questions like this, and even on the Broadcom side I had trouble
getting Arend to answer simple questions. Ultimately, with minimal to no
vendor cooperation, this driver becomes a reverse engineered, community
supported driver, with the inevitable gaps in testing and support that
entails when we don't have the information the manufacturers do, and
people need to understand the consequences of that. If the manufacturers
aren't stepping up to do their job, other members of the community (or
customers of those vendors) need to do so if there are hardware
configurations they rely on, because Daniel and I can't sign up to
proactively maintain and test every single Broadcom and Cypress/Infineon
chip out there. We don't have the hardware, nor do we have that kind of
bandwidth/time. Support for hardware that no maintainer/developer is
proactively testing will necessarily fall back to being reactive to
regression reports.

Personally, I do think the rPi folks themselves should step up for
*testing* at the very least. I did point them at our downstream WiFi
branch at one point during a previous discussion and haven't heard back,
so either they never tested it, or they did and it didn't break
anything. If they're shipping popular Linux hardware where the WiFi
chipset vendor has fully and completely checked out of any upstream
support, they need to either accept that upstream support will likely
break at some point (because that's just what happens when nobody cares
about a given piece of hardware, especially with drivers shared across
others like this one) or they need to proactively step up and take on,
minimally, an early testing role themselves.
