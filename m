Your email reminds me of this comic:

https://xkcd.com/2347/

In the last few years we seem to be getting more of these "Work faster!"
emails and honestly it's getting frustrating for us maintainers. If
Linux wireless is important for you then help us! You can review
patches, run tests on real hardware, write hwsim test cases[1], fix
compiler warnings[2] etc. to help us maintainers and speed up
development. There's so much to do and while you gain experience on the
wireless development you can help even more.

Also take it into account that it's not just simple to "take patches"
and be done with it. There are high quality requirements, the code needs
to have no compiler warnings and must not cause any regressions in
existing setups. That's not easy at all, especially as our hardware
testing is basically limited to few the most active drivers. And let
alone there are very exotic hardware out there and it's impossible to
test all of them.

If you have patches you want to submit to linux-wireless: please read
carefully our documentation (starting from the wiki link below) and then
go to the main Linux documentation[3]. Once you have a good
understanding how we prefer patches to be submitted, submit a patch. But
I always recommend starting from something small, taking baby steps and
learning from the feedback. This gives the best chances of patches being
accepted.
