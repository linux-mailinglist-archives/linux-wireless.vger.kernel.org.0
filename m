[ Upstream commit cbaccdc42483c65016f1bae89128c08dc17cfb2a ]

When compiling with clang 16.0.6 and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y, I've
noticed the following (somewhat confusing due to absence of an actual
source code location):

./include/linux/fortify-string.h:592:4: warning: call to '__read_overflow2_field'
declared with 'warning' attribute: detected read beyond size of field (2nd
parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Wattribute-warning]
                        __read_overflow2_field(q_size_field, size);

The compiler actually complains on 'mac80211_hwsim_get_et_strings()' where
fortification logic inteprets call to 'memcpy()' as an attempt to copy the
whole 'mac80211_hwsim_gstrings_stats' array from its first member and so
issues an overread warning. This warning may be silenced by passing
an address of the whole array and not the first member to 'memcpy()'.
