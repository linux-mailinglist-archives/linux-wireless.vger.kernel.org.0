I still use ipw2200 on Intel PRO/Wireless 2915ABG [Calexico2] Network
Connection card, in my IBM Thinkpad X41 (Pentium-M 1.73GHz, Centrino
platform). The laptop is rock solid, and I use it as a backup for my
other Thinkpad. In fact is sometimes preferable to more modern machines
(IMHO X41 itself is the best laptop ever made in terms of a design).

Never had really issues with WiFi on it. In terms of speed it is neither
far or slow, but does the job anyway.

Now, I do not use this laptop frequently, maybe once or twice a month.
But that is more because in I use laptops less in general these days. Not
because the machine is not usable. I have modern SSD in it, second hard
drive, two USB 3.0 ports via ExpressCard, high res 4:3 (1440x1050)
display, full disk encryption, etc.

I would really like for this driver to stay in the mainline for another 5-10
years.

I might be interested in modernizing the driver, but I have no idea how
much effort it would be (in terms of changed fraction of code). 20k LOC is
neither small or big, and not obvious (a lot of it would be unchanged),
if it is a week of work, or months of work.

I would not have an issue with removing it, and readding back if somebody
(or me) ports it, if not for re-review from scratch concerns. If I port
it, I would not be able to do re-review, 1) out of date coding standards,
2) different reviewers, 3) I would only port needed parts, and keep rest
of the driver intact, so I would not be able to really provide much
insight. So, readding after porting might be harder than keeping and
porting.

I also used in the past other drivers you are removing (zd1201, hostap,
orinoco, rndis, wl3501), but I do not have too much worry about them, as
they are ancient, and also require ancient hardware to run.


Cheers,
Witold
