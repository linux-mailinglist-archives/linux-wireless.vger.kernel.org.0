Agreed.

Len,
Do you recall any other case that we may miss the RTC wakeup event?

It is not a kernel problem.
It is a problem for suspend-automation. Because suspend-automation is
chasing for kernel suspend problems, and IMO, cases like suspend aborts
because of long suspend delay from PCH thermal driver are not kernel
problems.

It would be nice to leverage a kernel I/F to get rid of such issues, 
But if the patch is rejected, I agree we can live without it.

thanks,
rui
