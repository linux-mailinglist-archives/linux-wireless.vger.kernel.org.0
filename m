Perhaps because this driver has approximately 0.1 direct maintainers
right now whose contributions are largely hem and hawing about things
without providing any real sustainable solutions, and your amazing
additions as the Wireless upstream maintainer have been things like
nitpicking whether or not I should use "v2:" in commit messages.

Just recently a patch was posted to remove the Infineon list from
MAINTAINERS because that company cares so little they have literally
stopped accepting emails from us. Meanwhile they are telling their
customers that they do not recommend upstream brcmfmac and they should
use their downstream driver [1].

As a reminder, the last patch authored by the sole (barely) active
maintainer of this driver was almost a year ago. The other two Broadcom
folks in MAINTAINERS haven't done anything in years. Arend himself has
admitted he only gets 20% time to work on this and it never actually
reaches anywhere near 20%.

Meanwhile Daniel here has been revamping large chunks of the driver
downstream, and fixing major longstanding issues with an intent to
upstream. But apparently his opinion doesn't matter.

Hey Linus, you have an M2 MacBook Air, right? I assume you want WiFi to
work on it properly upstream some day. With the dismal state of brcmfmac
maintainership, and with the disdain the people involved have for the
people *actually* doing the work on the driver and trying to get
everything upstream, that is never going to happen at this rate. Care to
chime in?

As far as I'm concerned, Cypress support should be ifdeffed out behind a
Kconfig flag marked BROKEN. If someone cares about it, they better step
up to maintain it and actually test things. We can't have companies
submitting device support patches and then checking out and abandoning
them and expect the remaining people actually working on the driver to
tiptoe around their code "just in case we break them" with no way to
actually test anything or properly support those chips. Even the
Raspberry Pi folks have been silent other than some empty words and no
actual action, so far. You'd think they'd care a bit more about shipping
hardware with zero actual upstream maintainer support, but apparently
they don't.
