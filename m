I don't think the bridge is an issue here.  AFAICT the bridge's I/O
and prefetchable memory windows are disabled, but the non-prefetchable
window *is* enabled and contains the space consumed by the ath11k
device:

  00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device a0b8 (rev 20)
	Bus: primary=00, secondary=56, subordinate=56, sec-latency=0
	Memory behind bridge: 8c300000-8c3fffff [size=1M]
  56:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Device 1101 (rev 01)
     Region 0: Memory at 8c300000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]

This code is needlessly complicated.  If you absolutely need
msi_config.total_vectors and can't settle for any less, you can do
this:

  num_vectors = pci_alloc_irq_vectors(ab_pci->pdev,
                                      msi_config.total_vectors,
                                      msi_config.total_vectors,
                                      PCI_IRQ_MSI);

  if (num_vectors < 0) {
    ath11k_err(ab, "failed to get %d MSI vectors (%d)\n",
               msi_config.total_vectors, num_vectors);
    return num_vectors;
  }

But it seems a little greedy if the device can't operate at all unless
it gets 32 vectors.  Are you sure that's a hard requirement?  Most
devices can work with fewer vectors, even if it reduces performance.
