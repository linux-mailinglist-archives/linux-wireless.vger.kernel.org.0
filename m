I've looked through the 6 GHz statement. One thing I'm not clear on is
whether the decision is effective immediately or only once the relevant
regulatory documents have been ammended (as noted in section 6.3). I did
not find an updated IR 2030 at least, so I wonder if these changes
should wait for that.

The document only seems to state that the DFS requirement is removed for
indoor use up to 200 mW EIRP. So this range may also need to have
NO-OUTDOOR added if DFS is removed. Hopefully when IR 2030 is updated
the restrictions will be clear.

I don't think that's something we've ever done. The regdb can contain
two entries for the same range in a given country, I'm not sure how that
will be handled by the kernel though. I'll have to look at the code.

Can this be changed so that the patch author is the same as the
information in the sign-off?

This looks okay to me.

To echo what I said above, I'm unclear whether this change is in effect
yet, and based what I've seen so far I think it would need to include
NO-OUTDOOR.

> +	(5925 - 6425 @ 160), (250 mW), NO-OUTDOOR, AUTO-BW, wmmrule=ETSI

I'm also unclear on whether this change is in effect yet.

Thanks,
Seth
