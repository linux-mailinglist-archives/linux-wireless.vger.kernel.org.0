Subject: [PATCH 1/2] iwlwifi: exclude GEO SAR support for 3168
Sender: linux-wireless-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-wireless.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org

From: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>

We currently support two NICs in FW version 29, namely 7265D and 3168.
Out of these, only 7265D supports GEO SAR, so adjust the function that
checks for it accordingly.
