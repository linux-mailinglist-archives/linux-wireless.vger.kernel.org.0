I was not sure which was the best place for such "reverse config trickery"  
so I just picked one of the possible ones (it's easy to tweak it anyway).

I think I'll now go with aspm.c but then I'll have to change aspm.o to 
obj-y which is really CONFIG_PCI because of the dir.

That's probably a good idea, yes.

I can take a look at that.

There was some case where it was needed based on the history search
but perhaps e1000e could do something to avoid calling it while still 
under the lock, it doesn't seem something that would immediately blow up
if that state adjustment is delayed slightly.
