Nice, do you have a link to the patches or a git tree which has
everything? And how difficult would it be for me to run vanilla
kernel.org kernel (no vendor kernels or anything like that) on Fairphone
5? Any documentation available for that?

I'm asking because I don't have a test setup for WCN6750 right now. It
would be awesome if I could use Fairphone for testing :)

Thanks, I added that to the commit message.

Ok, I added that as well.
