Certain 802.11a/g/n Atheros chips provide a 0,5dB tx-power step granularity, while Mediatek 802.11ac chips have 1dB or even 3dB step width. So I would argue that a 1dB step width is a good compromise as the common value for new tpc algorithms.

The ath9k chips I have used so far support a minimum tx-power of -5dBm (=0,32mW), Mediatek has a min of 0dBm (=1mW)â€¦ so I would argue to use 0dBm  (=1mW) as common minimum tx-power value, as the any possible spatial reuse gain happens from 0dBm up to max tx-power.
