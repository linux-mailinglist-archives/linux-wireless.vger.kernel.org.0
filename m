Using my personal email account to comment. Broadcom has pulled away 
most resources from the brcm80211 drivers as there is no business 
interest for it and it turned into a one-fifth man show as I was granted 
to work one day a week on brcm80211. Nice theory but in practice other 
work always takes priority. So "nearly unmaintained" is no exaggeration. 
I probably can not meet the expectations some people in the community 
have regarding driver maintainers, but I can still review patch 
submissions although I should keep a better eye on the list to do that. 
It would not be my choice to abandon brcm80211, but if my contributions 
are considered insufficient than I will accept that fact.

Ever since Infineon took over Cypress wifi business things turned quiet 
soon. Their website still claims brcmfmac is the driver to use. Earlier 
this year I did have contact with them to hear whether they were 
committed to the driver. At least I got an answer, but not much more 
than that.

Regards,
Arend
