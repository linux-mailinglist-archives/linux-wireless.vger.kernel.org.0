As I said, the commit, or at least the part of it that broke iwd (it's not clear
that it's the whole commit), needs to be reverted.

I just hope that, simultaneously, the iwd developers will consider improving the
design of iwd to avoid this type of recurring issue in the future.  After all,
this may be the only real chance for such a discussion before the next time iwd
breaks.

Also, part of the reason I'm asking about what functionality that iwd is relying
on is so that, if necessary, it can be properly documented and supported...

If we don't know what we are supporting, it is very hard to support it.
