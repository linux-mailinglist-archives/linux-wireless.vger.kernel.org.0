I think you'll probably have to share a more complete hostapd log, and
likely also send to Jouni/hostap list.

You're talking about the AP, which is transmitting the association
response. How could the AP possibly have sent an EAPOL msg 1/4 before
getting an ACK on the association response? Why are there retries for
this anyway?

Are you sure this is with an in-kernel driver?

Hostapd should be creating the stations?

Yeah, but ... why isn't hostapd doing that?

Not going to happen, you need to find the real cause of this.
