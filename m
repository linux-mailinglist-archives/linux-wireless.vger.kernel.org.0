Depending on something in the kernel does not eliminate a dependency; it just
adds that particular kernel UAPI to your list of dependencies.  The reason that
we're having this discussion in the first place is because iwd is depending on
an obscure kernel UAPI that is not well defined.  Historically it's been hard to
avoid "breaking" changes in these crypto-related UAPIs because of the poor
design where a huge number of algorithms are potentially supported, but the list
is undocumented and it varies from one system to another based on configuration.
Also due to their obscurity many kernel developers don't know that these UAPIs
even exist.  (The reaction when someone finds out is usually "Why!?")

It may be worth looking at if iwd should make a different choice for this
dependency.  It's understandable to blame dependencies when things go wrong, but
at the same time the choice of dependency is very much a choice, and some
choices can be more technically sound and cause fewer problems than others...

The Linux kernel is also large, and it's made larger by having to support
obsolete crypto algorithms for backwards compatibility with iwd.

OpenSSL takes advantage of CPU-based hardware acceleration, e.g. AES-NI.

What is the specific functionality that you're actually relying on that you
think would need 40K lines of code to replace, even using OpenSSL?  I see you
are using KEYCTL_PKEY_*, but what specifically are you using them for?  What
operations are being performed, and with which algorithms and key formats?
Also, is the kernel behavior that you're relying on documented anywhere?  There
are man pages for those keyctls, but they don't say anything about any
particular hash algorithm, SHA-1 or otherwise, being supported.
