No it's great, the point is it directly identified the root cause 
without access to the platform, it's not so easy.

I only have the pcie module not the SDIO one.

For the scan situation, he understands what is being asked via 
connmanctl "enable wifi", but he feels something wrong

connmanctl> enable wifi

connmanctl>
Enabled wifi

52 is EBADE, I recall you mentioned that the scan api had been changed 
recently... is this possibly related to that?  Grepping around for EBADE 
near the function it mentions, it tries to take evasive action if it 
sees one in some places already.
