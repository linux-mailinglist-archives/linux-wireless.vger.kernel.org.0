Responding to myself here, I think we should do the partial disables
because it matches what the drivers did previously by hand, we can
reduce the number of code paths, and the resulting device state will
be the same regardless of CONFIG_PCIEASPM.

Yes.  I assume the reason those drivers call pci_disable_link_state()
is because some hardware defect means ASPM doesn't work correctly.

This change means pci_disable_link_state() will disable ASPM even when
the OS doesn't own ASPM or CONFIG_PCIEASPM is unset.  I think those
cases are unusual and probably not well tested, and I suspect that if
we *did* test them, we'd find that ASPM doesn't work with the current
kernel.

So I think this is more likely to *fix* something than to break it.
