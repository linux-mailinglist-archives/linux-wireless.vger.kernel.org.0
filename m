I can look up in advance what kind of train is planned for a certain
journey, I need train number and date for that. About one day in advance
I can say which EMU is planned for the trip.

I am also on Deutsche Bahn's customer advisory board ("Kundenbeirat"),
but I must say that Deutsche Bahn is not very enthusiastic in helping
with this issue. I do, however, have a quite direct link to the project
managers involved with Wifi On ICE. They seem to be keeping a close
guard over their tech staff though.

Thanks to all participants on this thread and issue on the Linux side,
we would not have come this far without your help.

Also, our current "fix" for the issue seems to have the side effect of
limiting the home network connection to 54 Mbit/s.

Greetings
Marc
