The point is that if this driver wants a notion of "cached DMA buffers", 
then it should allocate such buffers the proper way, not try to reinvent 
it badly. That means using dma_alloc_pages(), or modern 
dma_alloc_noncoherent() which is essentially the same thing but with the 
dma_map_page() call automatically done for you as well.

Thanks,
Robin.
