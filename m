Have you reported these?

We should discover device defects as early as possible so we can add
quirks for them.  Defaulting to ASPM being partly disabled means it
gets much less testing and users end up passing around "fixes" like
booting with "pcie_aspm.policy=default" or similar.  I do not want
users to trip over a device that doesn't work and have to look for
workarounds on the web.

I also think it's somewhat irresponsible of us to consume more power
than necessary.  But as Mani said, this would be a big change and
might have to be done with a BIOS date check or something to try to
avoid regressions.
