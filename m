And I see there another issue which does not allow to fully move code
from aspm.c file. Bridge does not have to support changing value in
PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS register or does not support setting 2.5 GT/s bits.
So logic for these checks needs to be in code which tries to retrain
link, in our case aspm.c.

And yes, there are bridges which do not support this functionality. It
applies also for PCI bridge implemented / emulated by kernel driver
drivers/pci/pci-bridge-emul.c.

So what we can do is just to move code which sets PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS
bits, not code which reads them and verifies that bridge is in correct
state.

Current quirk code has already code path when it forbid link retraining
and therefore forbid enabling ASPM when "bad bridge" (e.g. that emulated
by kernel) is in use.
