I see it from a different angle: a power up of the WiFi+BT chips. This
includes devices like wcn3990 (which have platform + serial parts) and
qca6390 / qca6490 / wcn6750 / etc. (which have PCI and serial parts).

From my point of view, the PCIe-only part was nice for an RFC, but for
v1 I have expected to see a final solution that we can reuse for
wcn3990.

Yes. And it is a correct representation of the device. The WiFi and BT
parts are powered up by the outputs from PMU. We happen to have three
different pieces (WiFi, BT and PMU) squashed on a single physical
device.

Is it so? The QCA6390 docs clearly say that all regulators should be
enabled before asserting BT_EN / WLAN_EN. See the powerup timing
diagram and the t2 note to that diagram.

The QCA6490 is also known as WCN6855. So this problem applies to
Qualcomm sm8350 / sm8450 platforms.

And strictly speaking I don't see any significant difference between
QCA6390 and WCN6855. The regulators might be different, but the
implementation should be the same.

I've been there and I had implemented it in the same way, but rather
having the pwrseq as a primary device in DT and parsing end-devices
only as a fallback / compatibility case.
