Right.

I started calling it link_num later, but that might also be confusing
and misinterpreted as num_links or so? ...

Right, we need to report multi-link stuff in a lot of places, inside the
LINKS attribute I guess.

I thought setting the address would be good enough when we create a
link, but maybe we need to be able to change it too, dunno. Not my
highest priority :)

Good point, I guess we need that.

Yeah you mentioned this to me elsewhere - you're right. I got confused
about MBSSID APs. I also made it so for MLD the NL80211_ATTR_SSID
attribute is now required in AP mode.

Agree. Also implementations are unlikely to want different tables for
different links, unless they're different NICs like in some of your use
cases, but copying the same table over to each is always possible.

Yep, I got confused, thanks.

Oh, I don't think CMD_ADD_LINK would set NL80211_FLAG_MLO_VALID_LINK_ID,
that's just helper functionality for those commands that expect
everything to already be set up.
