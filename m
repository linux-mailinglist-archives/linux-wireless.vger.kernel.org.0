Hi!
I=E2=80=99ve been working on a new LocalTalk interface driver for the =
last couple months, do you think it would be possible to at least =
postpone the removal of LT a bit?

It is a driver for an open source device called TashTalk =
(https://github.com/lampmerchant/tashtalk), which runs on a PIC micro =
that does all the LT interfacing, and communicates back via serial to =
the host system. My driver is relatively simple and works very well with =
netatalk 2.2 (which is still maintained and still has support for =
AppleTalk). The driver is basically complete and trsted and I was =
preparing to submit a patch.

Still having LocalTalk in my view has many advantages for us enthusiasts =
that still want to bridge old machines to the current world without =
modifications, for example for printing on modern printers, netbooting, =
sharing files and even tcp/ip. All this basically works out of the box =
via the driver, Linux and available userspace tools (netatalk, macipgw).

The old ISA cards supported by COPS were basically unobtanium even 20 =
years ago, but the solution of using a PIC and a serial port is very =
robust and much more furure-proof. We also already have a device that =
can interface a modern machine directly via USB to LocalTalk.

The development of the TashTalk has been also extensively discussed on =
thr 68KMLA forum =
(https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/modtashtalk-lt0-driver-for-linux.=
45031/)

I hope the decision to remove LocalTalk can be reconsidered at least for =
the time being so there is a chance to submit a new, modern device =
making use of this stack.

Many Thanks,
Rodolfo Zitellini=
