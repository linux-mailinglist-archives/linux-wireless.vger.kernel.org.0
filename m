Thanks Johannes and Jeff for the comments.

As per my understanding, if client supports reading the 4th bit of 
regulatory info sub-field (i.e, dot11ExtendedRegInfoSupport is true) in 
HE Operation Element. it needs to use the values from "Table E-13,Â  
P802.11Revme_D7.0". I didn't keep the value 4 definition as it is 
reserved currently in "Table E-13" .


If we need to support both "Table E-12" (applicable when 
dot11ExtendedRegInfoSupport is not true) and "Table E-13" (applicable 
when dot11ExtendedRegInfoSupport is true) with same client, then I think 
value "12" also should be considered as Indoor AFC standard power type 
as per "Table E-12". So, we need to map to 4, 8 and 12 to Indoor AFC 
standard power type. Please let me know if this is fine.
