I think that's not worth it, as I hope to introduce the new commands in
the near future (but you know how it is with the last 5 to 10
percent...). But let me show you how it's then supposed to be done in
this situation, that way you can give early feedback:

  #regzbot report: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218364
  #regzbot introduced: 0a3d898ee9a8

That "#regzbot report" will be new and make it more obvious to users
what regzbot should consider to be the report (e.g. what Link:/Closes:
tags later in commits fixing the issue will link to). You used "#regzbot
introduced: 0a3d898ee9a8 ^" and due to the "^" it assumed the start of
this thread would be the report (side note: mixing that aspect into the
"introduced" command was a stupid idea anyway.).

That "#regzbot link:" will vanish as well (at least from the docs, it
will remain to be supported), as people use it wrong in various
different ways: for duplicates, reports (like your did), patch
submissions fixing the issue (then 'regzbot monitor' should have been
used) among others. Which is totally understandable now that I look at
it. That's why it will be replaced by "#regzbot related: <url>" to avoid
any connection with the Link: tag used in commits; for duplicates
"#regzbot dup:" will stay around.

Let me do it, it's easy for me. And FWIW, I don't even follow the stable
releases for that, I just drop Greg a mail when I notice the patch
reached mainline through the weekly net merge. He'll take care of the rest.

Maybe at some point regression tracking can help somewhat with that. But
I still have to fix a few things to make people use it and scale it up.

Side note: some people seem to have gotten the impression that I care a
lot about *all* stable/longterm kernels. Let me use this opportunity to
say that it's not really the case. I fully understand and respect that
those series are a somewhat separate thing some developers don't want to
be involved in (especially the older trees). But the thing is: the
latest stable tree is what we tell users to use -- and something quite a
few important distros ship as their regular kernel these days. That's
why I take special care of regression that found there.

Ciao, Thorsten
