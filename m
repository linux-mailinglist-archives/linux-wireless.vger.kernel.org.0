So, if nobody from Cypress chimes in ever, and nobody cares nor tests
Cypress chipsets, are we keeping any and all existing Cypress code-paths
as bitrotting code forever and adding gratuitous conditionals every time
any functionality needs to change "just in case it breaks Cypress" even
though it has been tested compatible on Broadcom chipsets/firmware?

Because that's not sustainable long term.
