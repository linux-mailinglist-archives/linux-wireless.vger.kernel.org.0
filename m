As mentioned in [1]:
"There is no space in 'struct page' to track the inflight pages, so
'pp' in 'struct page' is renamed to 'pp_item' to enable the tracking
of inflight page"

As we still need pp for "struct page_pool" for page_pool_put_page()
related API, the container_of() trick is used to get the pp from the
pp_item.

As you had changed 'struct net_iov' to be mirroring the 'struct page',
so change 'struct net_iov' part accordingly.

Currently the size of pool->items is calculated in page_pool_create_percpu()
as below, to make sure the size of pool->items is somewhat twice of the
size of pool->ring so that the number of page sitting in the driver's rx
ring waiting for the new packet is the similar to the number of page that is
still being handled in the network stack as most drivers seems to set the
pool->pool_size according to their rx ring size:

+#define PAGE_POOL_MIN_INFLIGHT_ITEMS		512
+	unsigned int item_cnt = (params->pool_size ? : 1024) +
+				PP_ALLOC_CACHE_SIZE + PAGE_POOL_MIN_INFLIGHT_ITEMS;
+	item_cnt = roundup_pow_of_two(item_cnt);

The question would be why do we need the pool->items to grow with the
additional overhead and complication by dynamic allocation of item, using
complicated data structure and concurrent handling?

As mentioned in [2], it was the existing semantics, but it does not means
we need to keep it. The changing of semantics seems like an advantage
to me, as we are able to limit how many pages is allowed to be used by
a page_pool instance.

I am really doubtful about your above claim. As at least the below
implementaion of dma_buf_unmap_attachment_unlocked() called in
__net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_free() seems be using the DMA API directly:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.7-rc8/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_dma_buf.c#L215

Or am I missing something obvious here?
