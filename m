I did. And honestly I didn't understand it - in the first place.

I re-tried to decipher the commit message and re-checked everything and 
I think the patch is fine as is:

What they probably mean in the commit message is: There is an USB id 
clash for 1286:2046 with their "Marvell NFC-over-USB driver" [0]. So 
that has nothing to do with bluetooth :)
However Commit 8a81a96bd116 ("NFC: nfcmrvl: update USB device id") 
restricted the InterfaceSubClass and the InterfaceProtocol for those 
devices, so that this clash does no longer exist. This patch here takes 
the correct ones fot this wifi adapter (I checked with lsusb).

If it's not that I really don't know what they mean: Neither 1286:2045 
nor 1286:2046 usb ids are used anywhere else tree-wide.

Fine?
