Do you have an example for the latter? I haven't really come up with one
yet.

That makes a lot of sense.

Right. Though in many cases that would have to get pushed down to the
driver, and that'd mean drivers have to be aware of all those possible
ways too? I'm not sure cfg80211 always has enough information to resolve
to one particular way of identifying, especially with roaming offload
etc. where you might actually need to push some identifying attribute
like the BSSID down to firmware?

Anyway, I guess that means we can put the link ID into a small struct or
something for the APIs, so we can extend it more easily later.

I'm not sure I can reasonably come up with all the possible ways to do
this in the initial work here. In fact, I'm wondering if I shouldn't
just focus on client with AUTH/ASSOC (not CONNECT) and AP for now, so we
can get something started...

Assuming we have all the data, yes.

Indeed. I'm not sure using multiple commands would be OK since in the
case of multiple, it might require them having the same seqno just like
multicast data frames? But I'm not sure what the spec is doing here now
:)
