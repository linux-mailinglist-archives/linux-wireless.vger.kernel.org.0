Yes, it can be done theoretically.
The tricky part seems to be how to handle the concurrency problem when
we evict the old pages and the old pages are also returned back to the
page_pool concurrently without any locking or lockless operation.

For now each item has only one producer and one consumer, so we don't
really have to worry about the concurrency problem before calling
page_pool_item_uninit() in page_pool_destroy() to do the unmapping
for the inflight pages by using a newly added 'destroy_lock' lock.
