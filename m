I don't think openwrt is a good metric in this case. These drivers are
for 20+ years old hardware, most likely running on really old x86
laptops. So the chances of them running openwrt on those laptops is low
and I would expect them to run more traditional distros like debian or
ubuntu. But of course this is just guessing.
