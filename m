Right.

Or, when the driver doesn't implement set_cqm_rssi_config (the old
method).  So the driver can stop supporting set_cqm_rssi_config when
it implements set_cqm_rssi_range_config.

When the driver wants to implement both methods it may be because the
hardware has a better method of handling the hysteresis than what is
implemented nl80211.c.  In that case, yes, it'd need to remember which
method was used and the parameters.  If set_cqm_rssi_range_config was
used the driver is expected to report when a momentary rssi
measurement goes out of the configured range.

That may be a good reason to keep supporting both methods.

Right, with one threshold the behaviour is unchanged.

I guess the answer is that if the driver implements both methods it is
expected to report threshold crossings according to the method that
was called last.
