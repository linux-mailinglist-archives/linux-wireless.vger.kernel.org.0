The submodules are represented as independent devices on the DT and I don't
think this will change. It's not even possible as they operate on different
buses so it's not like we can MFD it with a top-level platform device and t=
wo
sub-nodes of which one is PCI and another serdev. With that in mind, I'm
insisting that there are two separate issues and a generic power sequencing
can be built on top of the PCI-specific pwrseq added here.

Alright, so let's imagine we do model the PMU on the device tree. It would
look something like this:

qca6390_pmu: pmic@0 {
	compatible =3D "qcom,qca6390-pmu";

	bt-gpios =3D <...>;
	wlan-gpios =3D <...>;

	vdd-supply =3D <&vreg...>;
	...

	regulators-0 {
		vreg_x: foo {
			...
		};

		...
	};
};

Then the WLAN and BT consume the regulators from &qca6390_pmu. Obviously we
cannot go:

wlan {
	pwrseq =3D &qca6390_pmu;
};

But it's enough to:

wlan {
	vdd-supply =3D <&vreg_x>;
};

But the pwrseq driver for "qcom,qca6390-pmu" could map BT and WLAN compatib=
les
to the correct power sequence and then the relevant drivers could enable it
using pwrseq_power_on().

But that comes back to what I'm doing here: the PCI part for ath11k still
needs the platform driver that will trigger the power sequence and that cou=
ld
be the PCI pwrseq driver for which the framework is introduced in this seri=
es.

As I said: the two are largely orthogonal.

Fair enough.

Would you mind posting an example DT code here? I'm not sure if I understan=

what "primary device" means in this context.
