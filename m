Well, this function doesn't drop anything :) It just answers a question
"is this a robust management frame", but if the question is nonsense
(calling it on a fragment other than the first) then the answer will
also be nonsense, right?

Right.

It's not really related to any specific category, is it?

Sure! But this isn't really a good way, nor would I argue it is safe ...

Perhaps ieee80211_rx_h_decrypt() needs to be more careful? I'm not even
sure where the frame really is being dropped.

Anyway, I really don't think this patch makes any sense, I think you
need to back up a bit and look at the higher layer(s) to see where and
why it's being dropped, and skip that if it's fragmented?
