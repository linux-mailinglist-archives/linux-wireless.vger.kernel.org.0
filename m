On these urls I can't find actual file to download, or I'm blind (or
don't understand how this site 'works').
Whatever I click I get new url and not binary file to download.

Could you give url for binary file that I could download, please?

Yes, it worked for few years but started to crash about few months ago
and that happened when I upgraded complete root filesystem, so it could
be related to upgraded firmware. Thank you for hint what to try to test.
