Thanks, good to know that you have had positive experiences with this
approach. As I didn't hear any concerns from anyone so I'm convinced we
should do this. I'm sure it will make my life a lot easier :)

Is anyone willing to submit patches? Use wireless-next as the baseline
for patches and one driver per commit, please. That way it's easy to
revert later, if needed (hopefully not).
