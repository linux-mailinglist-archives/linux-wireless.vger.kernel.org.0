We can extend the memory_type enum, with something like MEMORY_DEVICE_DMABU=
F?

I didn't think it would matter that the DMA API doesn't work with
these pages, because the mapping already exists courtesy of
dma_buf_map_attachment(), and these dma-buf pages don't need to be
mapped (the dma_addr is already available). I'm providing
dma_buf_map_sg() in that patch to use instead of the DMA API. Would be
nice to help me understand why we would care why the DMA API doesn't
work with these pages when we're asking code using these pages to use
the provided API instead?

This seems to be a semantics issue. Would setting the pages as
MEMORY_DEVICE_DMABUF address this?

Option 2, I think, doesn't care about the sg_page NULL. But it may be
pointless to discuss, I don't see how we could modify the page pool,
networking stack, and all the networking drivers to do anything other
than struct page (someone feel free to correct).

Who? I'd love to add them on subsequent proposals.

Would using p2pdma API instead of dmabuf be an acceptable direction?

The nice thing about what I'm doing is that any existing dmabuf
exported would be supported, AFAICT. To use p2pdma I think I would
need to modify the drivers providing the device memory to do a
pci_p2pdma_add_resource(), and use the pci_p2pdma_map_sg() on the
importer driver (NIC), but that may work, with driver changes.

Would that be an acceptable direction to you? Or are you against the
approach in the RFC and don't have any alternative path forward for
this? Is this not a use case we want to support in some way in the
kernel?

I CC'd get_maintainers.pl output and you because you showed interest
and get_maintainers did not add you automatically.
