Ack. This seems to be a mistake in the vendor driver, my datasheet
also states that bit 1:2 have initial value of '2', which results
in a value of 4. Anyway it doesn't matter as long as MIMO_PS isn't
enabled (bit 3), so it's safe to remove it or set the correct default
value.

TX_PIN_CFG is also set in rt2800_config_channel() as well as
rt2800_vco_calibration(), so no need to touch it during init.

Ah, ok, that's a bit funny, because it means that this change actually
never made any difference, because the codepath wasn't executed.

I'm on my way to post v2.
