Do you remember anything more about these warnings? I tried to check the
git history and at least quickly couldn't find anything related to this.

The changes look very safe to me, struct urb::context field and the out
variable are both of type 'void *' so removing the explicit casts should
change anything. I cannot really come up a reason why would this patch
cause new warnings so I am inclined towards taking this patch. What do
you think?
