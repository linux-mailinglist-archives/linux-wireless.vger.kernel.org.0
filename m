Hi Johannes,
Thanks for the response, I need more help.

Is rcu_read_lock is not allowed around dev_close() because it might 
block or *ANY* lock?
Because both functions with new dev_close() themselves are called with 
locks held,
(1) ieee80211_do_stop() happens inside 
wiphy_lock(sdata->local->hw.wiphy)
(2) ieee80211_del_iface() happens inside mutex_lock(&rdev->wiphy.mtx).
Should these be unlocked temporarily too before calling dev_close()?
Didn't find any instance of wiphy.mtx lock/unlock in mac80211.

Also, in cfg.c, list_for_each_entry(sdata, &local->interfaces, list) is 
called with two different murexes: (1) local->iflist_mtx
(2) local->mtx

Which is the correct one for this purpose among above two and 
rcu_read_lock()?
Once that decided, would following be sufficient -
     lock()
     list_for_each_entry(sdata, &local->interfaces, list) {
         get_child_pointer
         unlock()
         dev_close()
         lock()
     }
     unlock

Thanks.
