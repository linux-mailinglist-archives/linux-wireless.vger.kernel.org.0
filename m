Thanks for the feedback Johannes. As I mentioned in my original email, I'm still
learning the RCU API, so I appreciate the insight from someone more
knowledgeable.

I'm not committed to using __must_hold(); would you be willing to accept this
patch if I change it to use lockdep_assert_held() instead?

Grepping through tx.c, I see ieee80211_set_beacon_cntdwn() is invoked in three
places:

- Line 5285: Inside the definition of ieee80211_beacon_get_ap(), which is only
  invoked in critical sections (both directly and in another nested call).
- Line 5439: Directly inside a critical section.
- Line 5471: Directly inside a critical section (same as previous).

I'm sorry to hear that; a solution to this problem sounds very useful. I'm
currently working on making my own static analyzer for performing more checks
than what sparse currently provides. Since you've worked on this problem and
have deeper insight into than I do, what sort of checks would you like to see
added to a tool like sparse (besides checking whether specific locks are held)?

Thank you,
Brent
