The power mode selection for client purely depends on how much tx power 
the user wants for the client. In short, subordinate mode type client 
can operate on more tx-power when compared to Default mode type client.
For example, let's assume they are going to connect to LPI AP. PSD for 
Default client should be -1 dBm/MHz or less and for sub-ordinate client 
should be 5 dBM/MHz or lessâ€‹ (US regulatory). Technically, the power 
mode of client affects the PSD which has indirect relation with the 
Tx-power.

So if user wants more PSD, in supplicant, it can be configured with 
Subordinate or else default type.

Reg your other question:
 > Anyway you're tied to what the AP is doing, no?
Yeah since for AP the command was introduced, leveraged the same for 
client to. But now since we have option to leverage from update beacon 
infra, something similar for client need to explore.
