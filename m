If you've got a WiFi device that connects to the host computer via USB, 
do you refer to it as a "wireless USB device" or as a "USB wireless 
device"?

The second would seem to be more logical, by analogy with things like a 
USB mouse or a USB thumbdrive -- we don't say "mouse USB device" or 
"thumbdrive USB device"!

Furthermore, the first ("Wireless USB") is in fact the name of a defunct 
specification for an Ultra-WideBand interface that would run the USB 
communication protocol over a wireless connection.

Nevertheless there are quite a few places in the kernel source that use 
"wireless USB" where they really mean "USB wireless".  (A few of them 
are gray cases, like "Sierra Wireless USB-to-WWAN", although here the 
word "Wireless" evidently is redundant -- maybe it is part of a brand 
name?)

Would there be any objection to a patch that does a wholesale conversion 
from "wireless USB" to "USB wireless"?

Alan Stern

PS: Similar reasoning applies to the term "wireless PCIe device", 
although here the number of offenders is smaller.
