I assume you and your family are in good health. I am the foreign
operations Manager

This being a wide world in which it can be difficult to make new
acquaintances and because it is virtually impossible to know who is
trustworthy and who can be believed, I have decided to repose
confidence in you after much fasting and prayer. It is only because of
this that I have decided to confide in you and to share with you this
confidential business.

overdue and unclaimed sum of $15.5m, (Fifteen Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only) when the account holder suddenly passed on, he
left no beneficiary who would be entitled to the receipt of this fund.
For this reason, I have found it expedient to transfer this fund to a
trustworthy individual with capacity to act as foreign business
partner.

Thus I humbly request your assistance to claim this fund. Upon the
transfer of this fund in your account, you will take 45% as your share
from the total fund, 10% will be shared to Charity Organizations in
both countries and 45% will be for me.

Yours Faithful,
Mr.Sal Kavar.
