Hi Randy and other developers,


First, let me express my appreciation to Randy for forwarding my message
to the mail list. However, given the mail list forwarded message doesn't
have the correct log file attached, I uploaded the content of the log
file to an online pastebin[1]. I hope this would help.


Sincerely,

Tommy Zhang
