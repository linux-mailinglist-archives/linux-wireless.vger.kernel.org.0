I'm bumping this old thread because it looks like the sparse warning is still
present in WILC driver, and I would gladly help getting rid of it, but since
there's already been a fair amount of discussions around it, I am not sure what
is expected/what should be done. Here is my understanding so far:
- Ajay has proposed a patch ([1]) which indeed fixes the warning but involves
many casts
- Johannes and Jouni then gave details about the original issue leading to those
casts ([2]): wpa_supplicant somehow forces the AKM suites values to be be32 at
some point, while it should be treated in host endianness
- as pointed by Ajay, the corresponding fix has been made since then by Jouni in
wpa_supplicant ([3]). The fix make sure to handle key_mgmt_suite in host
endianness AND to keep compatibility with current drivers having the be32 fix. -
 - It could have allowed to simply get rid of the all casts on AKM suites in
wilc driver ([4]), but then new kernel/drivers would break with existing
userspace, so it is not an option

Now, I see multiple options to fix the sparse warning:
- apply the same fix as for wpa_supplicant ([3]) in wilc driver (so basically,
become compatible with both endianness)
- apply the same fix as for wpa_supplicant ([3]), not in wilc but in nl80211
(may need to update not only wilc but any driver having trailing be32 cast on
AKM suites)
- take the initial quick but not-so-nice double cast fix and call it a day

What's your opinion on this ?
