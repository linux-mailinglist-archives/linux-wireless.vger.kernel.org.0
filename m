Agree.

We'll see, but I don't _actually_ think this will significantly change
the architecture here.

In any case we can always kick the can further down the road.

Partially, yes, but also architecturally it should fit in.

I'd say though that "actively maintained" part really is because full-
MAC devices that are supported are very few now with Broadcom having
essentially dropped out. I suspect there are other full-MAC chips and/or
firmwares on the market, but few, if any, supported upstream. There's no
particular reason this must be the case, it's just the way hardware
architecture seems to be going.

And as you said before, mac80211 is doing more and more offloads too, so
the line ends up blurring from both sides.
Which then again is part of my concern, if we blur the line from both
sides we need to be even more careful to not grow into a parallel zone
too much.

I actually agree.


> This feels "thick", like David mentioned above.

This is kind of getting to the core of the thread: I, for one, don't
think he made that argument. He just *claimed*, without much argument
for that claim, that "Mwifiex is designed based on a "Thick FW"
architecture."

Nor does "we are using standard cfg80211 commands", FWIW. That doesn't
mean we need to think the architecture is good. Taking this argument to
the extreme, it'd be entirely possible to put a (modified) copy of
mac80211 into a driver and claim "we are using standard cfg80211
commands". It's a non-argument.

And really here we get to the core of the issue: Brian, you have now
mostly done the actual _technical_ analysis (and defence) of this patch
that I was waiting for _David_ to do.
