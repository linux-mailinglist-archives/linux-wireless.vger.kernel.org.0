What I am trying to say is this:

With current code, this can happen, which is not good, because transfers 
from multiple threads can be interleaved and interfere with each other:

thread 1                         thread2
do_some_higher_level_op() {
  ...
  read_register_0x3b0000() {
   claim_bus
   CMD52 0x00
   release bus                    ksdioirqd() {
                                    claim_bus
                                    CMD52 0x0f, lets read SDIO_CCCR_INTx
                                    release_bus
   claim bus                      }
   CMD52 0x00
   release_bus
   claim_bus
   CMD52 0x3b
   release_bus
   claim_bus
   CMD53 lets read data
   release_bus
  }
  ...
}

What should happen is either:

thread 1                         thread2
                                  ksdioirqd() { // option 1
                                    claim_bus
                                    CMD52 0x0f, lets read SDIO_CCCR_INTx
                                    release_bus
                                  }
do_some_higher_level_op() {
  claim_bus
  ...
  read_register_0x3b0000 {
   CMD52 0x00
   CMD52 0x00
   CMD52 0x3b
   CMD53 lets read data
  }
  ...
  read_another_register()
  ...
  release_bus
}
                                  ksdioirqd() { // option 2
                                    claim_bus
                                    CMD52 0x0f, lets read SDIO_CCCR_INTx
                                    release_bus
                                  }

That's what this patch implements, to avoid the interference.

Maybe I should include the infographics? Or reword this somehow?

I think we have a misunderstanding here, see above.

It always was the upper layer (wlan.c) that attempted to do bus locking, 
except it was incomplete. The acquire_bus()/release_bus() primitives 
seems to be an attempt at serializing bus access across multiple 
operations (which really boils down to multiple SPI or SDIO commands).

The problem is, acquire_bus()/release_bus() does not really work, 
because it does not prevent e.g. ksdioirqd from inserting a command on 
the SDIO bus. SDIO (or really, mmc framework) has its own way of doing 
bus locking, that's the sdio_claim_host()/sdio_release_host(), SPI does 
have spi_bus_lock()/spi_bus_unlock() which I should use in V2.

Those sdio_claim_host()/sdio_release_host() and 
spi_bus_lock()/spi_bus_unlock() should be called in 
acquire_bus()/release_bus() to correctly serialize bus access across 
multiple operations. That will also eliminate the custom and not really 
functional hif_cs mutex.

Not quite, I don't think the intention was to let anything communicate 
with the WILC device within block "protected" by 
acquire_bus()/release_bus() pair. That's why I believe this is where bus 
lock and unlock should happen too.

Because of acquire_bus()/release_bus() which I think is an attempt to 
serialize bus access across multiple complex operations (=commands sent 
to the card), see above.

With spi_bus_lock()/unlock() we can actually dispose of the hif_cs mutex 
altogether.
