We dropped MD4 because there are no users in the kernel. It is not the
kernel's job to run code on behalf of user space if it does not
require any privileges and can therefore execute in user space
directly.

The fact that AF_ALG permits this is a huge oversight on the part of
the kernel community, and a major maintenance burden. The point of
AF_ALG was to expose hardware crypto accelerators (which are shared
resources that /need/ to be managed by the kernel) to user space, and
we inadvertently ended up allowing the kernel's pure-software
algorithms to be used in the same way.

The fact that we even added APIs to the kernel to accommodate iwd is
even worse. It means system call overhead (which has become worse due
to all the speculation mitigations) to execute some code that could
execute in user space just as well, which is a bad idea for other
reasons too (for instance, accelerated crypto that uses SIMD in the
kernel disables preemption on many architectures, resulting in
scheduling jitter)

Note that in the case of iwd, it is unlikely that the use of AF_ALG
could ever result in meaningful use of hardware accelerators: today's
wireless interfaces don't use software crypto for the bulk of the data
(i.e., the packets themselves) and the wireless key exchange protocols
etc are unlikely to be supported in generic crypto accelerators, and
even if they were, the latency would likely result in worse
performance overall than a software implementation.

So iwd's deliberate choice to use the kernel as a crypto library is
severely misguided. I have made the same point 4 years ago when I
replaced iwd's use of the kernel's ecb(arc4) code with a suitable
software implementation (3 files changed, 53 insertions, 40
deletions). Of course, replacing other algorithms will take more work
than that, but it is the only sensible approach. We all know the cat
is out of the bag when it comes to AF_ALG, and we simply have to
retain all those broken algorithms as executable code at the kernel's
privileged execution level, just in case some user space is still
around that relies on it. But that doesn't mean we cannot be very
clear about our preferred way forward.
