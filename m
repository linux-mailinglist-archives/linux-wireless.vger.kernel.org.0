Hi Jonas,

> The Marvell 88W8897 combined wifi and bluetooth card (pcie+usb version)
> is used in a lot of Microsoft Surface devices, and all those devices
> suffer from very low 2.4GHz wifi connection speeds while bluetooth is
> enabled. The reason for that is that the default passive scanning
> interval for Bluetooth Low Energy devices is quite high on Linux
> (interval of 60 msec and scan window of 30 msec, see le_scan_interval
> and le_scan_window in hci_core.c), and the Marvell chip is known for its
> bad bt+wifi coexisting performance.
> 
> So decrease that passive scan interval and make the scan window shorter
> on this particular device to allow for spending more time transmitting
> wifi signals: The new scan interval is 250 msec (0x190 * 0.625 msec) and
> the new scan window is 6.25 msec (0xa * 0.625 msec).
> 
> This change has a very large impact on the 2.4GHz wifi speeds and gets
> it up to performance comparable with the Windows driver, which seems to
> apply a similar quirk.
> 
> The scan interval and scan window length were tested and found to work
> very well with a bunch of Bluetooth Low Energy devices, including the
> Surface Pen, a Bluetooth Speaker and two modern Bluetooth headphones.
> All devices were discovered immediately after turning them on. Even
> lower values were also tested, but these introduced longer delays until
> devices get discovered.

you can not do it this way. Modifying hci_dev internals from within the driver is not acceptable.
