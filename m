Yes, all these tests shows that these Atheros chips are stable only when
link is operating at 2.5 GT/s.

Yes, this is truth. In my opinion these Atheros chips are trying to do
some kind of init / reset procedure when either entering or leaving
Recovery state. And because there is known bug that Hot Reset should be
avoided, it looks like that Hot Reset is just one from more options how
to trigger this bug.

Tested and it does not work. Same effect as Hot Reset. This really looks
like OTP/EEPROM related issue which was already described, that doing
(something) related to reset too fast cause internal chip to not finish
reading OTP/EEPROM data needed to correctly initialize PCIe part of
card.

I understood that changing ASPM bits require to retrain link. But
personally, I really do not understand how these power management stuff
like ASPM is working. And because I'm reading lot of times that ASPM is
broken (some people are blaming kernel, other x86 BIOS bugs, others also
PCIe cards). This bug was "hidden" for a long time as lot of users are
using OpenWRT kernels and I have not found any discussion or bug report
where OpenWRT people document something related to this issue. Looks
like that they just disabled ASPM, which makes this bug hidden for a
long time.

But result is that tested cards with this patch are stable also when
ASPM is enabled.

If I understand it correctly then PCIe link is already up when kernel
starts enumeration. So setting Bridge TLS to 2.5 GT/s does not change
anything here.

Moreover it would have side effect that cards which are already set to
5+ GT/s would be downgraded to 2.5 GT/s during enumeration and for
increasing speed would be needed another round of "enumeration" to set a
new TLS and retrain link again. As TLS affects link only after link goes
into Recovery state.

So this would just complicate card enumeration and settings.

Moreover here we are dealing with specific OTP/EEPROM bug in Atheros
chips, which was confirmed that exists. As I wrote in previous email, I
was told that semi-official workaround is do Warm Reset or Cold Reset
with turning power off from card. Which on most platforms / boards is
not possible.

Yes.

Really? Is not rather zero returned when some particular bits are not
implemented in PCIe registers?

Returning all-ones may confuse lspci as it would think that all bits are
supported = all speeds are supported, including 5 GT/s, 8 GT/s, ...

Yes! And code is doing it already with bridge, not device. In parent
variable is stored pointer to bridge. Just flag is stored in device part
as buggy is device.
