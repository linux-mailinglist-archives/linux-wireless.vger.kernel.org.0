This was just a comment about the doc not matching the function
behavior.

I think we have to support pci_enable_link_state() even if the driver
hasn't previously called pci_disable_link_state(), so drivers have to
be able to specify the pci_enable_link_state() @state from scratch.

Does that answer the enforcement question?  I don't think we can
really enforce anything other than that @state specifies valid ASPM
states.
