Sure, ideally we can find and fix the underlying issues these next few
days, but since this regression was introduced in rc5 in an attempt to
address the QCN9074 issue which has been there since 6.1 I think we
need to revert otherwise.

Yes, I have a bunch of those enabled. Lockdep does not complain, but the
hard lockup detector triggers and it looks like CPU0 (which handles most
interrupts on this machine currently) has got stuck while processing an
interrupt.

RCU also detects the stall on CPU0 and provides a task dump for
ksoftirqd with the following call trace:

	__switch_to
	run_ksoftirqd
	smpboot_thread_fn
	kthread
	ret_from_fork

I just tried the out-of-tree pseudo NMI series [0] to get a stack trace,
but CPU0 does not respond to those either when I hit this.

Note that it takes a bit of RX to trigger this, but I hit it as soon as
I try to download something substantial (e.g. after a couple of MB).
