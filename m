My question is whether the state of the device should depend on
CONFIG_PCIEASPM.  If the driver does this:

  pci_disable_link_state(PCIE_LINK_STATE_L0S)

do we want to leave L1 enabled when CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y but disable L1
when CONFIG_PCIEASPM is unset?

I can see arguments both ways.  My thought was that it would be nice
to end up with a single implementation of pci_disable_link_state()
with an #ifdef around the CONFIG_PCIEASPM-enabled stuff because it
makes the code easier to read.
