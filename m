hostapd could crash without being able to clean up, though.
So I think you need a way to query the kernel's state and
clean it up in this case.

A station may be long lived, and it may be bad at cleaning up
its sessions, so the AP may end up with a large amount of classification rules
that are not actually needed, possibly slowing down performance
and/or limiting other stations from being able to add their own
flows.

Can you add time duration and/or detect idle flows and clean them
up automatically on the AP?

Thanks,
Ben
