>=20

Yeah. I actually _considered_ that, but didn't feel it was really any
different (or let's say wrong) now.

That said, I probably don't understand the lingo around runtime PM well
enough, and am more or less conflating "runtime PM" and "runtime
suspend" in my head, which is still not allowed, and indeed that's the
whole point of the patch.

*shrug*

Like I said, terminology I'm not familiar with. I guess I can change it,
or if anyone ends up committing it as is (rather than treating it as an
extended bug report) they can :-)

The code here causes quite some trouble if it _does_ happen and it was
incredibly tricky to debug.
