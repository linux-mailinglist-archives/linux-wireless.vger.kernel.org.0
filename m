You will have to options: reply to the first report with a "#regzbot
duplicate https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325423423423542"
or add a comment to the bugzilla ticket pointing to a report already
tracked by regzbot, e.g. "#regzbot duplicate
https://lore.kernel.org/not_relevant/msgid-423423423423423423/"

Not that I know of. Guess kernelnewbies might be the best place for that
(and maybe they have something like that already...).

Ciao, Thorsten
