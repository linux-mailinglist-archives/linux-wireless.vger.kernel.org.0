Right. The update frequency is also quite different, so I'm assuming the
pcie/uart version I'm using has a lot of vulnerabilities left open as
well...

That sounds like a safe bet..
I assume the firmwares are not compatible and we can't just load these?

Right, it really depends on why the firmware crashed, but we have no way
of investigating that at the moment.

If it works well enough it could be a reason not to bother :D
Alternatively if they can't spend time on it maybe open the firmware
code (under NDA? my company probably already has one with NXP..), but
my problem will need more time to reach them through regular channels.
