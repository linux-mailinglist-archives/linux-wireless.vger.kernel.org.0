Not xen_dma_ops? In any case, I'll send out a patch for the the Xen
folks to comment on.

Right. I suppose we assume any holes in the ranges are addressable by
the device but won't get used for other reasons (such as no memory
there). However, to be correct, the range of the dma offset plus mask
would need to be within the min start and max end addresses. IOW,
while we need to round up (0xa_8000_0000 - 0x2c1c_0000) to the next
power of 2, the 'correct' thing to do is round down.
