Subject: [PATCH 00/11] mmc: sdio: Move SDIO IDs from drivers to common include file
Date:   Fri, 22 May 2020 16:44:01 +0200

Most SDIO IDs are defined in the common include file linux/mmc/sdio_ids.h.
But some drivers define IDs locally or do not use existing macros from the
common include file.

This patch series fixes above inconsistency. It defines missing macro names
and moves all remaining SDIO IDs from drivers to the common include file.
Also some macro names are changed to follow existing naming conventions.
