It worths mentioning that there is a semantics changing here:
Before this patch, there can be almost unlimited inflight pages used by
driver and network stack, as page_pool doesn't really track those pages.
After this patch, as we use a fixed-size pool->items array to track the
inflight pages, the inflight pages is limited by the pool->items, currently
the size of pool->items array is calculated as below in this patch:

+#define PAGE_POOL_MIN_ITEM_CNT	512
+	unsigned int item_cnt = (params->pool_size ? : 1024) +
+				PP_ALLOC_CACHE_SIZE + PAGE_POOL_MIN_ITEM_CNT;

Personally I would consider it is an advantage to limit how many pages which
are used by the driver and network stack, the problem seems to how to decide
the limited number of page used by network stack so that performance is not
impacted.
