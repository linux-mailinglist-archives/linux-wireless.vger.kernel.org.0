I can confirm this behavior on my configuration. I managed to login once =

and select the Wifi and connect to it. It seemed curiously enough be=20
stable long enough to enter the Wifi passphrase. After the connection=20
was established, the system hang and on each attempt to reboot into the=20
graphical system it would freeze at some point (sometimes even before=20
showing the login screen).

Kernel was both based on 5.10-rc2 and 5.10-rc3 (I did see the same=20
behavior) with the patch applied, 7fef431be9c9 reverted and firmware=20
downloaded and copied to /lib/firmware/ath11k/QCA6390/hw2.0/.
