Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking. Thx for this fix.

FWIW: In case you need to send an improved patch, could you
please add this before the 'Reported-by:' (see at (ยน) below for the
reasoning):

Link:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/bff7d309-a816-6a75-51b6-5928ef4f7a8c@exuvo.se/

And if the patch is already good to go: could the subsystem maintainer
please add it when applying?

What's the plan to getting this merged? Just wondering, because there
*afaics* wasn't any activity for a week now. Yes, e383c70474db was a
commit for v5.2-rc1, so it's not a new regression that needs to be
handled really urgently. But it's still a regression that would be good
to get fixed rather sooner than later, as there might be still people
out there then might run into this on a update.

Ciao, Thorsten (carrying his Linux kernel regression tracker hat)


(ยน) Long story: The commit message would benefit from a link to the
regression report, for reasons explained in
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst. To quote:

```
If related discussions or any other background information behind the
change can be found on the web, add 'Link:' tags pointing to it. In case
your patch fixes a bug, for example, add a tag with a URL referencing
the report in the mailing list archives or a bug tracker; [...]
```

This concept is old, but the text was reworked recently to make this use
case for the Link: tag clearer. For details see:
https://git.kernel.org/linus/1f57bd42b77c

Yes, that "Link:" is not really crucial; but it's good to have if
someone needs to look into the backstory of this change sometime in the
future. But I care for a different reason. I'm tracking this regression
(and others) with regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot. This
bot will notice if a patch with a Link: tag to a tracked regression gets
posted and record that, which allowed anyone looking into the regression
to quickly gasp the current status from regzbot's webui
(https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot ) or its reports. The
bot will also notice if a commit with a Link: tag to a regression report
is applied by Linus and then automatically mark the regression as
resolved then.

IOW: this tag makes my life a regression tracker a lot easier, as I
otherwise have to tell regzbot manually when the fix lands. :-/


P.S.: As a Linux kernel regression tracker I'm getting a lot of reports
on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them. Unfortunately
therefore I sometimes will get things wrong or miss something important.
I hope that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to
tell me about it in a public reply. That's in everyone's interest, as
what I wrote above might be misleading to everyone reading this; any
suggestion I gave they thus might sent someone reading this down the
wrong rabbit hole, which none of us wants.

BTW, I have no personal interest in this issue, which is tracked using
regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot
(https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/). I'm only posting
this mail to get things rolling again and hence don't need to be CC on
all further activitie wrt to this regression. Ohh, and feel free to
ignore the following lines, they are meant for regzbot:
