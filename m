Overall, the first three patches in the series can go in without the
rest, so let's put them into a separate series.

Patch [4/7] doesn't depend on the first three ones, so it can go in by itself.

Patch [5/7] is to be dropped anyway as per the earlier discussion.

Patch [6/7] is only needed to apply patch [7/7] which is controversial.

I think that we can drop or defer patches [6-7/7] for now.
