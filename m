Why is it that every patch Hector submits seems to end up with flame
wars? Look, we have a lot to do and please understand that our time is
limited. PLEASE listen to the review feedback and try to fix the patches
for the next review round, so that we can get this patch applied and
move forward.

And also these "we know better than you do" comments from people who
clearly are not really familiar with Linux wireless project, or even
kernel development, are not helping. Especially if it's in an HTML mail
(which our lists automatically drop).
