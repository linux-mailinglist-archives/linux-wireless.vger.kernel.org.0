Align that 128Bit Buffer to Cache Align = Pure, 32Bit,64Bit,128Bit

Subject: Hardware Dual Encrypt & Decrypt : Hardware Accelerators


(indirect) - Plan & method RS

Modulus Dual Encrypt & Decrypt package : Processor feature (c)RS

AES-CCM & AES-GCM & Other Cypher Modulus + CCM & GCM can be
accelerated with a joint AES Crypto module,

Processor feature & package : Module list:

2 Decryption pipelines working in parallel,
With a Shared cache & RAM Module
Modulus & Semi-parallel modulating decryption & Encryption combined
with Encapsulation Cypher IP Protocol packet

Parallax Cryptographic Processing Unit: RS

The capacity To Multiply decryption on specific hardware in situations
such as lower Bit precision is to be implemented as follows:

On AES-NI & ARM Cryptographic processors; In particular PPS(ARM+) & SiMD ..

The capacity to exploit the fact that the nonce is 16Bit to 64Bit &
full float upto 128Bit for legal decryption (client) means there is a
simple method to use:

In situations that a AES-NI & ARM Cryptographic unit can process 2
threads on a 256Bit Function we can do both the main 128Bit/192Bit &
the nonce 16Bit to 64Bit & Enable a single instruction Roll to
Synchronise both The main HASH & Nonce.

AES & Crypto hardware can utilise the CPU/GPU/Processor FPU & SiMD to
decrypt the nonce (smaller so fast) & in the same 8bto to 64Bits of
code; Inline & parallax the cryptographic function.

With a 256Bit AES-NI & Cryptographic unit : Parallel Decryption &
Return Encryption by using 2x 128Bit & a Processor Enciphered Nonce.

ICE-SSRTP GEA Replacement 2022 + (c)RS

"GEA-1 and GEA-2, which are very similar (GEA-2 is just an extension
of GEA-1 with a higher amount of processing, and apparently not
weakened) are bit-oriented stream ciphers."

GEA-2 > GEA-3 is therefor 64Bit Safe (Mobile calls) & 128Bit Safe
(Reasonable security)
SHA2, SHA3therefor 128Bit Safe (Reasonable security Mobile) ++
AES & PolyChaCha both provide a premise of 128Bit++

So by reason alone GEA has a place in our hearts.

IiCE-SSRTP : Interleaved Inverted Signal Send & Receive Time Crystal Protocol

Interleaved signals help Isolate noise from a Signal Send & Receive ...

Overlapping inverted waves are a profile for complex audio & FFT is the result.

Interleaved, Inverted & Compressed & a simple encryption?

*

Time differentiated : Interleave, Inversion & differentiating Elliptic curve.

We will be able to know and test the Cypher : PRINCIPLE OF INTENT TO TRUST

We know of a cypher but : (Principle RS)

We blend the cypher..
Interleaved pages of a cypher obfuscate : PAL CScam does this

Timed : Theoretically unique to you in principle for imprecision, But
we cannot really have imprecise in Crypto!

But we can have a set time & in effect Elliptic curve a transient variable T,
With this, Interleave the resulting pages (RAM Buffer Concept)

Invert them over Time Var = T

We can do all & principally this is relatively simple.

Good for cables ? and noise ?

Presenting :  IiCE-SSR for digital channel infrastructure & cables
<Yes Even The Internet &+ Ethernet 5 Band>

So the question of interleaved Bands & or signal inversion is a simple
question but we have,

SSD & HDD Cables & does signal inversion help us? Do interleaving bands help us?

In Audio inversion would be a strange way to hear! but the inversion
does help alleviate ...

Transistor emission fatigue...

Firstly we need a good solid & stable /dev/random

So we can examine the issue with a true SEED!
