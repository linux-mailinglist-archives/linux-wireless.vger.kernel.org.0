Hm.
So, currently the device is put into WoW mode instead of powering it off because
of issues in the MHI subsystem.
At least this patch series indicates so:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/1607708150-21066-1-git-send-email-kvalo@codeaurora.org/
 
On the other hand, my device seems to have trouble with that workaround.
Maybe powering it off completely helps.

Do you have a pointer to said MHI issues?

Thanks,
