I get that. But it seemed like your types.h is full of inline
functions. That is what I was responding to. I would leave the inline
functions in page_pool.h unless there is some significant need for
them.

Actually my suggestion is more about defining boundaries for what is
meant to be used by drivers and what isn't. The stuff you could keep
in net/core/page_pool.h would only be usable by the files in net/core/
whereas the stuff you are keeping in the include/net/ folder is usable
by drivers. It is meant to prevent things like what you were
complaining about with the Mellanox drivers making use of interfaces
you didn't intend them to use.

So for example you could pull out functions like
page_pool_return_skb_page, page_pool_use_xdp_mem,
page_pool_update_nid, and the like and look at relocating them into
the net/core/ folder and thereby prevent abuse of those functions by
drivers.
