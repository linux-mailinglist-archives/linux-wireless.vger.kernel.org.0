I sure do know :) I assume you will announce in the regressions list
once the new interface is available, I'll then take a look at it in
detail and update my notes.

Thanks, this looks very intuitive to me.

Actually I did that on purpose as I wanted to test how including a mail
to a regression report works :)

So, in the new interface, how should I handle a situation that a
regression is first reported on the mailing list, added to regzbot and
later there's also a bug report opened for the issue?

I just feel it should be more than that, I'm worried that randomly
taking wireless commits to stable releases is risky. There really should
be someone looking after wireless (read: reviewing patches) in stable
releases. This would be a good role for someone who is interested to
learn how kernel.org development works and helping the community. Do we
have a way to announce these kind volunteer vacancies somewhere? :)

Yeah, I understand that a lot of users use stable kernel releases. But
the reality is that we in wireless really don't have the bandwidth to
manage stable kernels, it is enough of a challenge to manage Linus'
releases. So help here is very much needed.
