Greetings From Mrs.Daniella Angelo Kyle, The wife of late Mr.Angelo
Kyle, who worked with Central Bank of Philippines for ten years before
he died on an auto POISON, in the year 2012. But, when my late husband
was alive, late Mr. Angelo Kyle, he deposited sum amount of Money
$10.3 Million US Dollars, in my name as the next of kin/beneficiary to
the funds.

This money is still with the leading Bank in Burkina Faso. Now I am
suffering for protracted cancer which has also affected part of my
brain cells. am in the hospital receiving treatments now, though, my
doctor has confirmed to me that, I have just few months to live on
earth due to my cancer condition in a hospital. waiting for the lord's
call.

Please with due respect, can you fulfill my wish to receive this funds
into your bank account and use it to help the less privilege and
building of an orphanage homes? I don't want my husband's efforts to
be used by the Government. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have
anybody as my family member,

Because, I cannot visit the bank, since I am critically sick on the
bed, receiving treatments; i am powerless to do anything by myself/and
had no child to Inherits, but my bank account officer advised me to
assign any of my trustworthy relative, person or partner with
authorization letter to stand on my behalf as the recipient of my
money but sorrowfully I don=E2=80=99t have any reliable relative person.

And before my husband died on auto POISON, in the year 2012, we had no
child. My dear, someone lucky, trustworthy, sincere & capable to
handle this project has to be chosen; and, I am choosing you as my
representative next of kin/beneficiary to receive this money into your
bank account. So that you can fulfill my wish to help the less
privilege and building of an orphanage homes! For, I do not want this
fund to be transferred into bank=E2=80=99s treasury as an abandoned or
unclaimed bill funds, I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by
the Government.
