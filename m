Now I see what you mean. Yes, I agree this is a good idea and can
simplify code. Quirk is not related to ASPM code and basically has
nothing with it, just I put it into aspm.c because this is the only
place where link retraining was activated.

But with this proposal there is one issue. Some kernel drivers already
overwrite PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS value. So if PCI enumeration code set some
value into PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS bits then drivers can change it and once
ASPM will try to retrain link this may cause this issue.

I had (private) discussion with Adrian Chadd about ABCD device id issue.
I hope that nobody is against if I put there summary and important parts
about secondary bus reset (=hot reset):


The reason for abcd is because:
* the MAC has hardware that upon cold reset, will read EEPROM/OTP
  values for things like PCIe and other register defaults, and squirt
  them into the MAC/PHY/etc registers
* the default values for the PCIe bus pre-AR9300 were 0x168c:0xff<id>,
  where <id> is the normal chip ID
* the default values for the PCIe bus POST-AR9300 were 0x168c:0xabcd,
  where they're always that regardless of the chip family
* so yeah, all you know with 0x168c:0xabcd is there's an atheros
  device there, but not WHICH it is.

* the bug is that the reset line isn't held low for long enough, or it's
  bounced twice in quick succession, before the MAC has time to program
  in the defaults from EEPROM/OTP and it doesn't do it a second time.

* the MAC has hardware that upon cold reset, will read EEPROM/OTP
  values for things like PCIe and other register defaults, and squirt
  them into the MAC/PHY/etc registers

* need to use the external reset line OR try using D3, not D3hot
  (I assume that "external reset line" means PERST# - PCIe Warm Reset
  and "D3, not D3hot" means D3cold)


And now my experiments: Disabling and Enabling link via root bridge has
exactly same syndromes as hot reset on all tested cards. See that
different chips (pre-AR9300 and post-AR9300) have slightly different
behavior and it matches all my experiments (I wrote test details in
commit message). And doing link retrain when root bridge has non-2.5GT/s
value in PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS has also same effect as hot reset.
So based on same results from my experiments all these actions
(disabling link, hot reset and link retrain) have common issue.
