I did some git analysis, and I actually believe that this issue has been
present since the commit e6f5b934fba8 ("b43: Add QOS support"). Before
then, non-QOS would not trigger this issue. There is a cosmetic change
after this commit, b27faf8ebf25 ("b43: Rename the DMA ring pointers"),
but this change does not introduce the issue (but makes it more
obvious). I think the reason nobody has ever reported this is that even
when the warnings are triggered, everything appears to work fine. I
think therefore the two options are the following.

1. Remap the BE queue to 0 instead of the BK queue.
2. Use this kind of conditional to handle the mapping when QoS is
   disabled.
