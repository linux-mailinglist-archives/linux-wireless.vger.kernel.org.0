OK, that's fair.

Yes, kind of, I meant different things later as my thinking evolved over
the course of writing the email :)

Need to be careful with alignment there, but otherwise yes?

Correct. I meant that we should probably know how many links we need up
front, so we could allocate

	n_links * (sizeof(*lsinfo) + sizeof(*lsta))

kind of.

But then again that might be more complicated?


We might be allocating a lot of these - so maybe it'd be worthwile to
get a kmem cache? But we can also do that later.

Makes sense, so let's just update the commit message for now.

Thanks,
