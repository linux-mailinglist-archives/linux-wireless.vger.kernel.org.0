Sort of. The actual (hardware) implementation seems a bit more
complicated than a "power switch", but yes, that's the effect of it.

No, that's the problem at hand AFAICT.

Right. That's being suggested here, but since the platform has no actual
hardware hotplug, that needs to be implemented in software.

The question at hand is *how* to actually achieve that.

I'm kind of arguing that it's not rfkill that achieves it, but the
underlying GPIO that toggles the device, since that GPIO could also be
bound to something other than an rfkill-gpio instance.
