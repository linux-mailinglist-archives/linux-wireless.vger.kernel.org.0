reduced the repeated code by using "out" label.Â  Can't make common 
utility function

for both roam and connect callbacks since variables in links struct 
differs for connect result and roam info.

Also, addressed several other comments about code cleanup and nits in v2.

Agree, Drivers should have enough formation to create a BSS entry for 
all the links.

As suggested added checks for all bss entries availability in v2 patch.

Without casting it gives below error.

note: expected 'void *' but argument is of type 'const u8 *' {aka 'const unsigned char *'}
