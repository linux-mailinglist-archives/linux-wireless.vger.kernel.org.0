"GEA-1 and GEA-2, which are very similar (GEA-2 is just an extension
of GEA-1 with a higher amount of processing, and apparently not
weakened) are bit-oriented stream ciphers."

"A stream cipher, such as the well-known RC4 or GEA-1, usually works
through using the Xor operation against a plaintext. The Xor operation
being symmetrical, this means that encrypting should be considered the
same operation as decrypting: GEA-1 and GEA-2 are basically
pseudo-random data generators, taking a seed (the key, IV and
direction bit of the GPRS data, which are concatenated),

The generated random data (the keystream) is xored with the clear-text
data (the plaintext) for encrypting. Then, later, the keystream is
xored with the encrypted data (the ciphertext) for decrypting. That is
why the functions called in the target library for decrypting and
encrypting are the same.

GEA-1 and GEA-2 are bit-oriented, unlike RC4 which is byte-oriented,
because their algorithms generate only one bit of pseudo-random data
at once (derived from their internal state), while algorithms like RC4
generate no less than one byte at once (in RC4's case, derived from

permutation done in its internal state). Even though the keystream
bits are put together by the current encryption / decryption C and
Rust libraries into bytes in order to generate usable keystream,
obviously.

Based on this, you can understand that GEA-1 and GEA-2 are LFSR:
Linear Feedback Shift Register-oriented ciphers, because their
internal state is stored into fixed-size registers. This includes the
S and W registers which serve for initialization / key scheduling
purposes and are respectively 64 and 97-bit wide registers, and the A,
B, C (and for GEA-2 only D) registers which serve for the purpose of
keystream generation, which are respectively 31, 32, 33 and 29-bit
wide registers.

On each iteration of the keystream generation, each register is
bit-wise rotated by one position, while the bit being rotated from the
left towards the right side (or conversely depending on in which bit
order you internally represent your registers) is fed back to the
algorithm and mutated depending on given conditions. Hence, the

shifted-out bit is derived from other processing, and reinserted,
while being for this reason possibly flipped depending on conditions
depending on bits present at the other side of the given register.

This is the explanation for the name of linear feedback shift register
(shift because of the shift operation required for the rotation, and
linear feedback because of the constant-time transform operation
involved).

The rest of the register may also be mutated at each iteration steps,
as in the case of the GEA-1 and 2, whole fixed Xor sequences (which
differ for each register) may be applied depending on whether the
rotated bit is a 0 or a 1.

Note that a step where the register iterates is called clocking (the
register is clocked), and that the fixed points where the register may
be Xor'ed when the rotated bit becomes a 1 are called taps. The linear
function which may transmute the rotated bit at the clocking step
(taking several bits of the original register as an input) is called
the F function.

Those kind of bit-oriented LFSR algorithms, such as GEA-1 and 2 (for
GPRS) and A5/1 and 2 (for GSM), were designed this way for optimal
hardware implementations in the late 80's and early 90's."
