This is a reminder for the Call for Proposals (CFP) for the Networking and
BPF track at the 2023 edition of the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) which is
taking place in Richmond, VA, United States, on November 13th - 15th, 2023.

Note that the conference is planned to be both in person and remote (hybrid).
CFP submitters should ideally be able to give their presentation in person to
minimize technical issues, although presenting remotely will also be possible.

The Networking and BPF track technical committee consists of:

     David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
     Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>
     Paolo Abeni <pabeni@redhat.com>
     Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
     Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
     Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
     Andrii Nakryiko <andrii@kernel.org>
     Martin Lau <martin.lau@linux.dev>

We are seeking proposals of 30 minutes in length (including Q&A discussion). Any
kind of advanced Linux networking and/or BPF related topic will be considered.

Please submit your proposals through the official LPC website at:

     https://lpc.events/event/17/abstracts/

Make sure to select "eBPF & Networking Track" in the track pull-down menu.

Proposals must be submitted by September 27th, and submitters will be notified
of acceptance by October 2nd. Final slides (as PDF) are due on the first day of
the conference.

We are very much looking forward to a great conference and seeing you all!
