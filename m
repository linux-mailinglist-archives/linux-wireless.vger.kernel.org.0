Sadly this is the normal in the wireless world. All vendors focus on the
latest generation, currently it's Wi-Fi 7, and lose interest on older
generations. And vendors lose focus on the upstream drivers even faster,
usually after a customer project ends.

So in practise what we try to do is keep the drivers working somehow on
our own, even after the vendors are long gone. If we would deliberately
allow breaking drivers because vendor/corporations don't support us, I
suspect we would have sevaral broken drivers in upstream.

Sure, but they could also respect to the review comments. I find Arend's
proposal is reasonable and that's what I would implement in v2. We
(linux-wireless) make abstractions to workaround firmware problems or
interface conflicts all the time, just look at ath10k for example. I
would not be surprised if we need to add even more abstractions to
brcmfmac in the future. And Arend is the expert here, he has best
knowledge of Broadcom devices and I trust him.

Has anyone even investigated what it would need to implement Arend's
proposal? At least I don't see any indication of that.
