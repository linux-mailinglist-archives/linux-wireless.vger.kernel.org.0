Forgive my ignorance about rfkill.  At least in this Tegra case, it
sounds like rfkill basically controls a power switch for the entire
device, i.e., it doesn't merely turn off the radio portion of the
device; it puts the entire PCI device in D3cold.

Is rfkill integrated with the power management subsystem?  E.g., when
lspci or X tries to read config space via pci_read_config(), does the
pci_config_pm_runtime_get() in that path wake up the device?

IMO, if the struct pci_dev exists, we should be able to rely on the
device actually being accessible (possibly after bringing it back to
D0).  If rfkill only turns off the radio, leaving the PCI interface
active, that would be fine -- in that case generic PCI things like
lspci would work normally and it would be up to the driver to manage
network-related things.

But if rfkill turns off PCI interface and the power management
subsystem can't wake it up, I think we should unbind the driver and
remove the pci_dev, so it wouldn't appear in lspci at all.
