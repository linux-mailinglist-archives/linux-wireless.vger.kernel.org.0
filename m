IWD uses AF_ALG/keyctl for _all_ its crypto, cipher, and checksum needs. 
Anything that wifi requires as far as crypto goes IWD uses the kernel, 
except ECC is the only exception. The entire list of crypto requirements 
(for full support at least) for IWD is here:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/wireless/iwd.git/tree/tools/test_runner_kernel_config

For KEYCTL_PKEY_* specifically we use it for all asymmetric crypto 
operations, (query), encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify.

I'll be honest, the AF_ALG/keyctl support in ELL was mostly done by the 
time I started working on IWD so I was not aware the documentation was 
so poor. That is an entirely separate issue than this IMO, and I'm happy 
to help with getting docs updated to include a proper list of supported 
features. In addition maybe some automated testing that gets run on 
kernel builds which actually exercises this API so it doesn't get 
accidentally get broken in the future? Docs/tests IMO are the proper 
"fix" here, not telling someone to stop using an API that has existed a 
long time.

I'm also not entirely sure why this stuff continues to be removed from 
the kernel. First MD4, then it got reverted, then this (now reverted, 
thanks). Both cases there was not clear justification of why it was 
being removed.

Thanks,

James
