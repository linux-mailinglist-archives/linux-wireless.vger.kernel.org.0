It is mostly white-space changes, but the diff is ugly.

I caused the DISABLE_EHT flag to be set in mac80211, and that generally
seems to work in my kernel, but something is still trying to do MLO I guess.

I did not specifically tell supplicant to do MLO, and in fact I told
it to disable_be, but maybe that is not fully implemented.  My supplicant
is a few months old vs upstream at this point.

Thanks,
Ben
