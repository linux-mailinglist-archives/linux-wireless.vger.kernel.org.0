Hmm. I didn't really want to change the behaviour there, and the auto-
loading is *highly* unlikely, you need to specifically set up a vhost-
user wmediumd (which I'm in the process of publishing).

And even then, you still need to have the radios, they just don't
communicate directly with each other but will go into wmediumd over the
virtio when you actually have virtio.

I'm not principally opposed to changing the default, but I'm not
convinced it'd be related to this patch in any way.
