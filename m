While I agree with older WiFi+BT units, I don't think it's needed for
WCN7850 since BT+WiFi are now designed to be fully independent and PMU is
transparent.

>> While tiny, this patch is possibly the highlight of the entire series.
>> It uses the two abstraction layers we introduced before to create an

>> With this series we can now enable BT and WLAN on several new Qualcomm
