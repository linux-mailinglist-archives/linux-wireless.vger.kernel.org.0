I did a bit more digging to see if I could find any new information,
I'm not sure I did but here's what I did / found.  I spent the time to
get a kdump kernel running and enabled, I was able to SysRq-C (both
via keyboard and echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger) and generate a crash
dump.  Actually viewing them at the moment will require reverting a
couple of patches to printk to fix the file for the crash utility
(https://github.com/crash-utility/crash/issues/67), but right now
that's not super important since the mechanism isn't being triggered.
As reported here and by Mitchell, the adapter will work occasionally,
but more often it will hang the machine (I too tried 5.10-rc3 with no
noticable differences).  Whatever is causing the system to hang isn't
triggering the kdump kernel to take over and dump the vmcore.  I've
set watchdog=1 , nmi_watchdog=1, hung_task_panic=1, softlockup_panic=1
trying to convince the kernel to dump it's state during this.  I've
not been able to make it write a crash, it just sits 'hung'.  One
interesting observation that may be related, is that if the lockup
occurs during my login, I can actually see the system grind to a halt
over the course of a number of frames (the rendering of the login
animations starts to stutter/get really slow, then after a few frames
everything is frozen).  If something were spin locking/ed, I'd expect
the soft lockup panic to find it, but I don't know these mechanisms
well.

The only consistent behavior that I managed to create is that if the
wifi adapter / machine are in a 'working' state (ie: I can browse the
internet, etc) and I issue sysrq-c to crash the kernel and then let
the crash dump write and reboot the machine, once booted the adapter
is no longer seen by the kernel, and there are zero messages in dmesg
that match "ath11k".  The driver shows up in lsmod , but it reports
zero messages and it's like the adapter is completely invisible.  A
power off and back on of the machine will re-enter it into the
freezing/wifi working lottery.
