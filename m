The report states in paragraph 203 that the order is effective 60 days
from publication in the Federal Register, and it looks like they haven't
even been published in the Federal Register yet. We will need to wait
for the rules to go into effect before applying any updates.

I think it should be sufficient to set the bandwidth of both 5730-5850
and 5850-5895 to 160 MHz with AUTO-BW. The kernel will see the AUTO-BW
flags and calculate a combined rule where 160 MHz is allowed, and for
the original rules any bandwidth exceeding the available bandwidth of
the rule will be disallowed.

I believe we have an additional requirement from ยง 15.407 (a)(3)(v):

  In the 5.850-5.895 GHz band, client devices must operate under the
  control of an indoor access point. In all cases, an exception exists
  for transmitting brief messages to an access point when attempting to
  join its network after detecting a signal that confirms that an access
  point is operating on a particular channel.

This sounds like a requirement for passive scanning, if so the range
should also have the NO-IR flag.

Thanks,
Seth
