Ah, you are right, so [3] is rather about supporting drivers sending values with
host endianness, while interface historically expects big endian :/

So I am the one confused :) Thanks for the clarification. I did not dig enough,
and since the cast is done right at connect message reception, I assumed wrongly
that the issue was on the supplicant->driver path.

Not sure to fully understand why its wrong (supplicant seems to expect AKM
suites to be provided) , but I may be lacking more general understanding about
the external auth process.
Or do you mean that AKM suites should be enforced to RSN_AUTH_KEY_MGMT_SAE only
in this driver->supplicant call (and so, not forward any possible value ?)

So we have to keep some big endian conversion on the driver/nl80211 ->
supplicant path, IIUC

Yeah, this suggestion is wrong because of the misunderstanding clarified above.

So to fix my initial suggestion, it is not "doing the same fix" but rather "move
the be conversion from the driver to nl80211 layer". Which matches in fact what
you are suggesting below.

If this kind of fix is ok in nl80211, I can do some tests with it, see how it
would affect other drivers ( I think there's only Quantenna driver which would
be affected)

Thanks,

Alexis
