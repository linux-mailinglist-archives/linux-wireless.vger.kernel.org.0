But it's a brief message "after detecting a signal that confirms that an
access point is operating on a particular channel." I think that implies
a passive scan, then sending an association request only after seeing a
beacon from the AP on the channel. I could be wrong though; my memory on
the 802.11 protocol is rusty and out of date.

Thanks,
Seth
