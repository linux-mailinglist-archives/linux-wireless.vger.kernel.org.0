Sorry for not responding sooner. I had started to look into this when
you sent the message, but I had to set it aside and then forgot to pick
it back up.

AUTO-BW doesn't make sense here, however it does look like the 5470 -
5725 rule could be expanded to 5730 to allow channel 144 to be used.

I agree that it looks like DFS is required, and also TPC which will
require us to use 100 mW as the max EIRP. Afaik the wmmrule doesn't
apply to the 5.8 GHz band, so I think that isn't required.

I'll send out a patch soon with these updates.

Thanks,
Seth
