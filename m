If only corporate acquisition politics didn't repeatedly throw a wrench
into this one... :/

This is where we are though, Infineon clearly doesn't care, so it's time
to move on.

The hilariously outdated kernel development model surely doesn't help
either (I've stated my opinion on this quite a few times if you've
followed around) ;)

This stuff gets *really* frustrating when you're trying to improve what
is, I hope we can all admit, an undermaintained driver (that is not to
say it's anyone's fault personally), and end up getting held back due to
everything from coding style nitpicks to people not having the time to
be responsive. It's just not helpful. It's important to know when to
step aside and let people actually get stuff done.

When Daniel started sending me brcmfmac patches downstream, I took a
look at a few of them, decided he knew what he was doing, and just
started pulling in his branches wholesale. Was it perfect? No, I had to
debug at least one regression at one point. But it took me less time to
do that than it would've to go through the commits with a fine toothed
comb, so it was clearly the right decision.

That is not to say that should be the standard upstream (we make a point
of moving fast and breaking things more downstream, since it's a proving
ground for what eventually will be upstreamed), but I think it does
demonstrate the kind of delegation ability that is sorely lacking in
many drivers and subsystems in the kernel these days. Maintainers become
entrenched in their position, long beyond the point where they have the
time/motivation/ability to drive the code forward, and end up in the way
of new people who are trying to make a difference. I think Linus knows
full well the kernel maintainer community is stagnating.

That doesn't mean people should step down entirely. But it does mean
they need to recognize when this is happening and, at least, proactively
try to bring new people in, instead of just continuing to play a
gatekeeping role. The role of maintainers should not be that of a wall
people have to climb over to get their changes in, it should be to guide
new contributors and help onboard people who can contribute, as peers
and eventually as future maintainers.

Kalle, in the other thread you said "this is not fun anymore, this is
more like a business with requirements and demands coming from
everywhere.". That's what it feels like to us when our changes get
rejected because the local vars aren't in reverse Christmas tree order,
or because our commit messages have "v2:" in them. It feels like some
manager is trying to justify their position by creating busywork for
everyone else. Nobody should actually care about any of those things,
and if they do, they need to step back and really ask themselves how
they ended up believing that. If the goal is to enforce a reasonable
shared coding style so things don't spiral into chaos, FFS, let's just
do what every other project does these days and adopt clang-format. Then
*all* of us can stop wasting time on these trivialities and go back to
getting stuff done. And really, nobody cares about commit messages as
long as the tags are right, the subject line is succinct, and the
important information is in there. Extra stuff never hurt anyone.

FWIW, I was hoping you'd stay on at least as a reviewer. Your
contributions are valuable. You obviously know the driver and hardware
much better than most people. I encourage you to, at least, post a v2 of
the MAINTAINERS patch with yourself as an R: line.

As far as the actual driver abstraction architecture, I'm going to leave
it to Daniel to decide what makes the most sense, since he's the one
introducing new mechanisms for that already. There's always room for
refactoring later though, depending on the direction things take with
the vendor split. BTW, clang-format also makes refactoring a lot less
painful ;)
