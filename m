[ Upstream commit 95f97fe0ac974467ab4da215985a32b2fdf48af0 ]

When compiling with clang 16.0.6 and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y, I've
noticed the following (somewhat confusing due to absence of an actual
source code location):

                        __read_overflow2_field(q_size_field, size);

                        __read_overflow2_field(q_size_field, size);

The compiler actually complains on 'ath9k_get_et_strings()' and
'ath9k_htc_get_et_strings()' due to the same reason: fortification logic
inteprets call to 'memcpy()' as an attempt to copy the whole array from
it's first member and so issues an overread warning. These warnings may
be silenced by passing an address of the whole array and not the first
member to 'memcpy()'.
