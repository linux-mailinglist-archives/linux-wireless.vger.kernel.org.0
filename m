I respect your opinion, but it seems we are stuck in a while(1) loop
without a break. Again, I don't agree with this. Adding a redundant null
check goes against code clarity instead of enhancing it. Just because the
condition checks for null does not justify its presence if it's redundant.
I could insert this check every two lines.
You advocate for this approach based on the potential occurrence in the
future. However, this is one of the reasons why there are reviewers like
yourself are responsible and authorized to approve or reject patches and
verify their integrity before acceptance.

Our discussion isn't about what the compiler will do; I know that. The
discussion revolves around the code itself. Alright, let's add a null
check for the 'env' parameter as well. Perhaps we could even automate this
process and add null checks for each function in the file.

Yes there is !
The check is literally redundant. Whether we keep it or remove it, the
outcome remains the same. In this case maybe it's not a big deal, but
adopting this approach could lead to an accumulation of redundant
statements throughout the codebase

add completely unnecessary confusion?

Even at this point there is a misunderstanding. The whole discussion is not
about the ack because you've already given it to the first version.
The discussion is because i'm interested in knowing different points of
views.
I think this discussion took more than its time.
This represents your personal point of view, with which I disagree.
Thank you again, and you can do whatever you want, continue with the first
or third version of the patch.
