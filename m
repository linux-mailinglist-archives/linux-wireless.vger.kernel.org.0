Is this statement in the readme of neojou not correct?
"This driver is based on Realtek's rtw89 driver 
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw89> 
in Linux main trunk. Or can refer to this lwfinger's github [rtw89] 
(https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89)"

I checked the dlink link and it is for a wifi5 device.
I don't know how I got there. :-(
There is no linux driver from dlink for the USB wifi6 device. :-(
Oh well, maybe in 10 years. :-)

"Chipset:/RTL8188EU/ Standard: IEEE 802.11n"
Would a good 8188eu driver make it easier to support wifi5 and wifi6 
devices?

Maybe it'll be in kernel eventually. :-)
