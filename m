It would be better if your email client allows you to respond without
the unnecessary repetition of the From/To/Cc/Subject lines above.  For
example, this would be sufficient:

Then it's shorter and easier to figure out who wrote what.

The BIOS or PCI core should configure both the bridge and the endpoint
so they are consistent.  If the driver needs to do something, e.g.,
via a module parameter, that means there's a BIOS or PCI core defect
that should be fixed.  It should be fixed in the PCI core, not in the
individual driver.

The fact that the parameter exists means *some* users do need it.  And
that is a huge problem because those users don't *know* they need it;
they just see a device that doesn't work, and they don't know why.
All they can do is try random combinations of parameters to see what
seems to work.  This just doesn't scale for users that deal with a
dozen different devices in their system.  We can't expect them to
fiddle with module parameters for each.

If your device is implemented correctly per the PCIe spec, there
should be no problem with changing L1SS configuration dynamically.  Of
course if there are PCI core defects that mean it doesn't work, those
can and should be fixed.

There are sysfs options for changing L1SS configuration, and it's
reasonable for users to change that based on changing workload.  I
expect tools like powertop to take advantage of that eventually.
