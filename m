Hi all,

I've just received the new NUC13 and it's quite nice. However, the
wireless chip appears to be too new to have mainline support.  To that
end, I've been ... messing with it.  :)

I believe the marketing term is an AX204.  I know for certain it's
0x7AF0 0x1692.  I am using kernel source 6.3-rc4 and attempting to add a
line to iwlwifi/pcie/drv.c that looks like this:

IWL_DEV_INFO(0x7AF0, 0x1692, something?, iwl_ax204_name),

I have looked at:
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005511/wireless.htmlï¿¼
However, this product isn't listed.

I know I'm missing the "something?" above and possibly on the wrong path
on other things.  I've had a couple of guesses that didn't work out
(stabbing in the dark), so asking here.  Any assistance appreciated!

Thanks!
