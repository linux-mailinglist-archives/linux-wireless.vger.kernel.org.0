That's all fine, I don't object to that at all.  But bus/device-specific
stuff should NOT be in drivers/base/ if at all possible (yes, we do have
some exceptions with hypervisor.c and memory and cpu stuff) but for a
frequency thing like this, why can't it live with the other
wifi/frequency code in drivers/net/wireless/?

In other words, what's the benefit to having me be the maintainer of
this, someone who knows nothing about this subsystem, other than you
passing off that work to me?  :)

thanks,
