I'm not sure If I fully understood the this comment.

This patch assumes that multiple radios are grouped under a single wiphy.
Each radio has its own list of frequencies it can scan, and there is no overlap
in frequencies between any two radios within the same wiphy.

If this assumption holds, then if one radio is operating on a DFS channel and a
new scan request does not include any frequencies from that radio's list, the
scan should be allowedâ€”since the DFS radio wouldn't be involved in handling that
scan request.

sure, this function should not be called with NULL scan_req and invalid
radio_idx. Better will remove the check: if (!scan_req).

It seems, (chan_radio_idx < 0) should never be true because the chan is
taken from the valid scan request. I should remove this check in next version?
