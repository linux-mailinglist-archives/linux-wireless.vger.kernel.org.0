This is a significant usability problem.  An interoperability problem
means the device doesn't work correctly for some users, and there's no
obvious reason *why* it doesn't work, so they don't know how to fix
it.

Module parameters are not a solution because users don't know when
they are needed or how to use them.  This leads to situations like
[1,2,3], where users waste a lot of time flailing around to get the
device to work, and the eventual "solution" is to replace it with
something else:

  After replacing the Realtek card with Intel AX200 I do not have the
  described problem anymore.

I think the fact that you need chip-specific code here is a hardware
defect in the rtw89 device.  The whole point of L1SS being in the PCIe
spec is so generic software can configure it without having to know
chip-specific details.

How can we make this better, so the device works and users never have
to specify those module parameters?

Would it help if we had a way to make a quirk that meant "never enable
L1SS for this device"?  Obviously that's not ideal because we want the
power savings of L1SS, but the power saving is only worthwhile if the
device always *works*.

Or maybe we could have a quirk that means "the PCI core will never
change the L1SS configuration for this device"?  Would that help?
