Good point, suspend and resume is very important for ath11k and ath12k.
And although I'm not expecting any issues with hibernation please also
consider that. Currently ath11k hibernation is broken because of MHI and
it has been pain trying to fix that. So best to make sure these cases
work from the beginning.

A big thank you from me too! It's great to finally see this solved so
that ath11k and ath12k can be used in wider range of devices.
