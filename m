Correct.  If we can at least get the DEL_INTERFACE supported, that would 
solve our immediate use case.

I do think that the drivers should not be creating a netdev by default 
and should wait until userspace asks for it.  But that is a separate 
topic, with backwards compatibility concerns, so I'll leave it for the 
future :)
