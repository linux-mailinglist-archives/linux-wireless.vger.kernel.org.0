Well, the RTC Fixed event can be armed in a PM/HIBERNATE notifier and
if it fires before .suspend() runs, system wakeup can be triggered
from there.

I'm not sure why this is a problem.

It only means that occasionally the system will not reach the final
"suspended" state, but that can happen regardless.
