When compiling with clang 16.0.6 and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y, I've
noticed the following (somewhat confusing due to absence of an actual
source code location):

The compiler actually complains on 'mt7915_get_et_strings()',
'mt792x_get_et_strings()' and 'mt7996_get_et_strings()' due to the same
reason: fortification logic inteprets call to 'memcpy()' as an attempt
to copy the whole array from its first member and so issues an overread
warning. These warnings may be silenced by passing an address of the whole
array and not the first member to 'memcpy()'.
