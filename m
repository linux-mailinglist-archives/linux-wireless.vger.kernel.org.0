Okay, so pragmatically, this needs a new maintainer. Would you be okay 
with adding myself as a co-maintainer? You could leave yourself as a 
maintainer or downgrade yourself to reviewer.

We should also remove the other two Broadcom folks from the maintainers 
list if they are effectively gone.

I expect my patch submissions to be reviewed by someone (in general); if 
we do this, that could be anyone (not just you), therefore unblocking 
upstreaming of Apple hardware related changes.

 From my point of view, pragmatically, the most useful things that a 
Broadcom employee can do to help this driver out without being an 
outright maintainer are:

- Answering questions (about firmwares, compats, hardware revisions, 
debugging, etc.) in a reasonably timely manner
- Testing on a wider variety of hardware

If someone can at least validate that my firmware version gates and such 
are done properly, then there's a chance we won't randomly break other 
chips. If someone can actively test on other hardware, even better. If I 
end up being the only one keeping the driver afloat, as I mentioned in 
my other reply, all I can promise is decent support on chips Apple uses.
