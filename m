I did some tests with regdb and I found out that the rule to be applied 
depends on the main 20 MHz channel. With the rules above, if I select 
channel 48 (5230-5250) and enable VHT40, then the TX power is set to 17 
dBm. OTOH if I select channel 44 (5210â€“5230) and enable VHT40, then the 
TX power is set to 20 dBm. I'm not sure whether my result is really 
correct, though.

Sungbo
