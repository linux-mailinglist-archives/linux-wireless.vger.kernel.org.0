I know, I asked you to.

That wouldn't be an issue.

The issue is that dev_close() needs to be able to sleep, and it even
contains a might_sleep(), so you can't do it under the RCU protection
you used here.

That seems kinda awkward, considering e.g. if hostapd crashes and then a
new instance has to clean up, it might not really have much knowledge of
the order in which it should be doing that.

I think it's better if you just fix the locking here?
