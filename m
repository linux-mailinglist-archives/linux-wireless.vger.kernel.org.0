Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker. Top-posting for once,
to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Iwlwifi maintainers, what happened regarding below regression report?
Looks like it was ignored, is there a reason why? There are two other
tickets reg. similar problems in bugzilla.kernel.org that look like they
were mostly ignored as well:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215635
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215697

Can anyone clarify what's up here? Are they all the same issue or are it
different ones?

And could the reporters of those tickets (CCed) please clarify in the
ticket if their problem still happens with the latest kernel (either
5.17.y or mainline; 5.16.y is irrelevant now, as it's EOL)

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.

After updating to 5.17 it is at the point where I cannot have an enjoyable match due to constant ping spikes, often to the point where the game will "stutter" or "lock up" every 10 seconds or say, with excessively high ping to go along with this. My VoIP applications have similar issues with calls often being interrupted or distorted.
