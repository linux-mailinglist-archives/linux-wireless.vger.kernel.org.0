Some devices will change their VID/PID after applied with calibration data (e.g. AR922X will do 168c:ff1d -> 168c:0029), but most device trees only record their post-calibration VID/PID in their compatibility string.

Should we match such device against their pre-calibration VID/PID only, and break all current device trees for them?

I think we could add these pre-calibration VID/PIDs to the ID-list of the PCI driver, but had better match compatibility strings against drivers, not devices.
