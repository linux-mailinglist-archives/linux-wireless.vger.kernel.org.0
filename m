Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developer don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216421

>  XiaoYan Li 2022-08-27 12:40:07 UTC
> 
> This is a regression. It doesn't happen on 6.0-rc.1 or 5.19 kernel.
> 
> Network card: MEDIATEK MT7922 802.11ax
> 
> ---
> wpa_supplicant: nl80211: kernel reports: key addition failed
> wpa_supplicant: TDLS: Failed to set TPK to the driver
See the ticket for more details.

I'd also like to add the report to the list of tracked regressions to
ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks in the end:

#regzbot introduced: v6.0-rc1..v6.0-rc2
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216421
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
