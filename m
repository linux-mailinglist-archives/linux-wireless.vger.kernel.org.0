No, moving to 'pci_ops' is terrible than having it in 'pci_host_bridge' IMO. If
we want to get rid of these ops, we can introduce a quirk flag in
'pci_host_bridge' and when set, the bwctrl code can disable/enable ASPM
before/after link retrain. This clearly states that the controller is quirky and
we need to disable/enable ASPM.

For setting OPP, you can have a separate callback in 'pci_host_bridge' that just
allows setting OPP *after* retrain, like 'pci_host_bridge:link_change_notify()'.
I don't think you really need to set OPP before retrain though. As even if you
do it pre and post link retrain, there is still a small window where the link
will operate without adequate vote.
