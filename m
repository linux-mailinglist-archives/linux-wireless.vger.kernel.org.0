Hi Arend,

> Hi Chi-Hsien, Marcel

> From the kernel side I do not see an issue. In order to use 802.1X offload the NL80211_ATTR_WANT_1X_4WAY_HS flag must be set in NL80211_CMD_CONNECT. Otherwise, NL80211_CMD_SET_PMK is not accepted. The only improvement would be to document this more clearly in the "WPA/WPA2 EAPOL handshake offload" DOC section in nl80211.h.

so nl80211 is an API. And an application can use that API wrongly (be that intentionally or unintentionally), the kernel can not just go WARN_ON and print a backtrace. That is your bug. So please handle wrong user input properly.

Frankly, I donâ€™t get why nl80211 itself is not validating the input and this is left to the driver. I think we need a nl80211 fuzzer that really exercises this API with random values and parameters to provide invalid input.

Regards

Marcel
