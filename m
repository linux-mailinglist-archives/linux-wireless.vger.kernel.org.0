WRT that patch, the original intent of "force_dma" was purely to 
consider a device DMA-capable regardless of the presence of 
"dma-ranges". Expecting of_dma_configure() to do anything for a non-OF 
device has always been bogus - magic paravirt devices which appear out 
of nowhere and expect to be treated as genuine DMA masters are a 
separate problem that we haven't really approached yet.
