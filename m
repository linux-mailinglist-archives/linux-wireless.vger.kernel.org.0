Hi Bjorn,

Thanks a lot for all your feedback so far, it has been very helpful.

I think there's still one important thing to discuss and none of the 
comments have covered that area so far.

The drivers that have workaround are not going to turn more dangerous than 
they're already without this change, so we're mostly within charted waters 
there even with what you propose. However, I think the bigger catch and 
potential source of problems, with both this v2 and your alternative, are 
the drivers that do not have the workarounds around CONFIG_PCIEASPM=n 
and/or _OSC permissions. Those code paths just call 
pci_disable_link_state() and do nothing else.

Do you think it's okay to alter the behavior for those drivers too 
(disable ASPM where it previously was a no-op)?

I'm okay with going the direction you indicated but I just wanted to ask
this in advance before reworking the behavior so I can take that detail 
also into account.
