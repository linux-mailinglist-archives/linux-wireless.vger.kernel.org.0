Or use k/v to tell STA that AP is going down immediately and here is (null, likely)
list of APs to associate with instead?

Another thing I notice:  In order to keep things from blocking for long periods (3+ seconds)
with rtnl held, I ended up doing a force flush in ath10k-ct, so at least when using that
driver, sending frames and then immediately doing flush will likely not put much on air.

I have hoped to one day add tx-completion call-backs handling to mac80211 instead of just calling a flush
for these types of station-down communication where flush is to be called shortly.

Thanks,
Ben
