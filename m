Yes, please send a new version with the explanation added. However, this
should include not just *what* is changed, but *why* as well. So maybe
something like:

"Note that with this change, the pointer address will be printed as a
hashed value by default. This is appropriate because the kernel
shouldn't leak kernel pointers to user space in an informational
message. If someone wants to see the real address for debugging
purposes, this can be achieved using the no_hash_pointers kernel option"
