[adding Linus to the list of recipients in case he want to clarify
things or pick up the revert in question directly; also CCing Greg due
to the stable aspect JFYI]

My approach/attitude is based on actions from Linus and/or what I expect
he wants me to do, so let's bring him in to give him a chance to state
if I went to far here.

Linus, Johannes' reaction was due to this mail of mine:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/5f64abc6-017f-4283-bf08-dba1aea28e9d@leemhuis.info/

To quote a bit more than Johannes did:

BTW, the fix in question can also be found here:

Well, Linus is known to have no problem at all with picking up fixes
straight from lists if there are good reasons (like the unlucky timing
we have here), as long as that does not become the norm. That approach
was actually used in the situation I pointed to, as it really is quite
similar.

And it might be the right thing to do in this situation as well, as then
the fix for this regression from v6.11-rc1 will reach 6.12 -- and likely
also reach users of 6.11.y stable releases within a week, as Greg likely
will pick this up quickly and usually publishes new stable releases at
least once per week.

If the revert is only merged during the merge window, it will likely
take the fix at least two weeks more to reach end-users, unless somebody
asks Greg "please pick this up now" once it reached mainline. Three
weeks if we for some reason get a 6.12-rc8. And if the fix is not in the
first batch of fixes picked by Greg after 6.13-rc1, there might be even
one more week on top of those outcomes. So four additional weeks if we
are really unlucky.

Things like that bother me -- and thus, yes, sorry, also influence my
attitude, which lead to the quoted "sigh". It's just that "fixes are
there, they just take a long time to reach mainline and stable releases"
is the biggest problem I see during my regression tracking work.

The problem is, that bring this up in situations like this is making the
"maintainer burnout" problem worse. I hate that and feed sorry for that.
But well, ignoring this sounds like the wrong solution as well. I could
write private "hey Linus, I think the following regression is not
handled well" mails instead. But Linus already has a lot on his plate as
well. And people call me a snitch if I do that. Hmmm. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
