Your dmesg log is incomplete, and we would need to see the entire
thing.  It should start with something like this:

  Linux version 6.8.0-60-generic (buildd@lcy02-amd64-054) (x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc-13 (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0, GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) 2.42) #63-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Apr 15 19:04:15 UTC 2025 (Ubuntu 6.8.0-60.63-generic 6.8.12)

Your lspci output doesn't include the necessary PCI details; collect
it with "sudo lspci -vv".

We should pick the most serious problem and focus on that instead of
trying to solve everything at once.

It sounds like the ath10k issue might be the biggest problem?  If
"options ath10k_core skip_otp=y" is a workaround for this problem, it
looks like some ath10k firmware thing, probably unrelated to the PCI
core.
