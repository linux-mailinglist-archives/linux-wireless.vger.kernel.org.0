Thanks Stephen, also for the other one!

I knew about the new ones as well but forgot to give you a heads-up, my

I'm planning to submit a wireless pull request today or tomorrow, and
then merge back into wireless-next once it settles in, so this should
hopefully be resolved by the end of the week or so.

Thanks,
johannes
