This can be addressed by doing thermal zone suspend after freezing
tasks and before starting to suspend devices.  Accordingly, thermal
zones could be resumed after resuming devices and before thawing
tasks.  That should not be an overly complex change to make.

Honestly, I don't see much benefit from using dev_pm_ops for thermal
zone devices and cooling devices.  Moreover, I actually think that
they could be "no PM" devices that are not even put on the
suspend-resume device list.  Technically, they are just interfaces on
top of some other devices allowing the user space to interact with the
latter and combining different pieces described by the platform
firmware.  They by themselves have no PM capabilities.

But the "belong" part is not quite well defined here.  I think that
what user space needs to know is what devices are located in a given
thermal zone, isn't it?  Knowing the parent doesn't necessarily
address this.

I'm not convinced about this.

I guess by the "parent" you mean the device represented in the ACPI
namespace by a ThermalZone object, right?  But this is not the same as
the "parent" in the Wifi driver context, is it?

No, it is not for cooling devices if my reading of the specification
is correct.  It says:

"_TZD (Thermal Zone Devices)

This optional object evaluates to a package of device names. Each name
corresponds to a device in the ACPI namespace that is associated with
the thermal zone. The temperature reported by the thermal zone is
roughly correspondent to that of each of the devices."

And then

"The list of devices returned by the control method need not be a
complete and absolute list of devices affected by the thermal zone.
However, the package should at least contain the devices that would
uniquely identify where this thermal zone is located in the machine.
For example, a thermal zone in a docking station should include a
device in the docking station, a thermal zone for the CD-ROM bay,
should include the CD-ROM."

So IIUC this is a list of devices allowing the location of the thermal
zone to be figured out.  There's nothing about cooling in this
definition.

I'm not sure I understand the above.

There is a list of ACPI device handles per trip point, as returned by
either _PSL or _ALx.  Devices whose handles are in that list will be
bound to the thermal zone, so long as there are struct acpi_device
objects representing them which is verified with the help of the
devdata field in struct thermal_cooling_device.

IOW, cooling device drivers that create struct thermal_cooling_device
objects representing them are expected to set devdata in those objects
to point to struct acpi_device objects corresponding to their ACPI
handles, but in principle acpi_thermal_should_bind_cdev() might as
well just use the handles themselves.  It just needs to know that
there is a cooling driver on the other side of the ACPI handle.

The point is that a cooling device to be bound to an ACPI thermal zone
needs an ACPI handle in the first place to be listed in _PSL or _ALx.

> As we cannot require all cooling devices to store an ACPI device pointer =

Cooling devices don't store ACPI device pointers in struct
thermal_cooling_device objects, ACPI cooling drivers do, and there are
two reasons to do that: (1) to associate a given struct
thermal_cooling_device with an ACPI handle and (2) to let
acpi_thermal_should_bind_cdev() know that the cooling device is
present and functional.

This can be changed to store an ACPI handle in struct
thermal_cooling_device and acpi_thermal_should_bind_cdev() may just
verify that the device is there by itself.

> we must use a more generic approach.

I'm not sure what use case you are talking about.

Surely, devices with no representation in the ACPI namespace cannot be
bound to ACPI thermal zones.  For devices that have a representation
in the ACPI namespace, storing an ACPI handle in devdata should not be
a problem.

It can be arranged this way, but what's the practical difference?
Anyone who creates a struct thermal_cooling_device and can set its
parent pointer to a device with an ACPI companion, may as well set its
devdata to point to that companion directly - or to its ACPI handle if
that's preferred.
