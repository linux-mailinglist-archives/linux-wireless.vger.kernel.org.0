I don't know which is uglier, a quirk in pcie_capability_write_word()
or a quirk in aspm.c that has nothing to do with ASPM.  They're both
ugly :)

FWIW, in pcie_capability_write_word() I would envision not a check for
Atheros, but rather something like a "dev->max_target_link_speed" that
could be set by an Atheros quirk.  It does get uglier if we want to
restrict the bridge's link speed via a quirk, then unrestrict it when
the endpoint is unplugged.

I know pcie_downgrade_link_to_gen1() only returns failure for corner
cases that "should not occur," but I don't like the fact that it's
possible to change Common Clock Configuration without doing the
retrain.  That would leave us with incorrect ASPM exit latencies,
which is really hard to debug.

Here's the relevant text in the spec (PCIe r5.0):

  7.5.3.6 Link Capabilities

    L0s Exit Latency - This field indicates the L0s exit latency for
    the given PCI Express Link. The value reported indicates the
    length of time this Port requires to complete transition from L0s
    to L0. ...

    Note that exit latencies may be influenced by PCI Express
    reference clock configuration depending upon whether a component
    uses a common or separate reference clock.

  7.5.3.6 Link Control
    Common Clock Configuration - When Set, this bit indicates that
    this component and the component at the opposite end of this Link
    are operating with a distributed common reference clock. ...

    After changing the value in this bit in both components on a Link,
    software must trigger the Link to retrain by writing a 1b to the
    Retrain Link bit of the Downstream Port.
