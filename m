Another issue with using BTF, is that the BTF would need to be saved in the
trace.dat or perf.data file, as many times the trace data is moved off to
another machine for offline analysis. And using the vmlinux would not be
useful, because there is several times you have multiple trace files for
various versions of a build and that would require mapping which
vmlinux/btf file goes with which trace data.

Right now, the conversions can easily be saved in the trace file directly.
