I wonder how easy is it to create subsets of BTF. For one thing, in the
future we want to be able to trace the arguments of all functions. That is,
tracing all functions at the same time (function tracer) and getting the
arguments within the trace.

This would only require information about functions and their arguments,
which would be very useful. Is BTF easy to break apart? That is, just
generate the information needed for function arguments?

Note, pretty much all functions do not pass structures by values, and this
would not need to know the contents of a pointer to a structure. This would
mean that structure layout information is not needed.
