Awesome, thank you!

Actually I would prefer to remove ipw2x00 and ps3-gelic-wireless as
well. I have not seen any evidence that there would be users for those
drivers. If we find out that there really are users I can easily add the
drivers back. The faster we get rid of wext the better, it really needs
to go away.
