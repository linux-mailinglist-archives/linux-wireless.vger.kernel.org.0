Hmmm, my understanding of the way the TLV WMI is supposed to work is 
that the individual data structures are extensible, and in the case 
where a data structure is received with a "short" length the recipient 
is supposed to zero-extend to the expected length, and then handle the 
"zeroed" field(s) appropriately. This is supposed to hold for both 
host=>firmware and firmware=>host. Since the wmi_service_ready_event has 
been extended over time this behavior is necessary in the case of a host 
built with the current format interfacing to a firmware built with an 
earlier version of the format. I'm not sure why ath10k isn't supporting 
this since the QTI "out of tree" driver (my area of focus) has that 
support.
