I think maybe you misunderstood the proposal. AFAICT the genalloc
stuff works for us, although there are other issues with p2pdma that I
need to solve.

The proposal was that the uapi in step #1 allocates a region of GPU
memory, and sets up a p2pdma provider for this region of memory. From
the perspective of the GPU, the memory is allocated, and in use by the
user. The p2pdma provider uses genalloc to give out 4K regions with
struct pages to in-kernel allocators from this memory region. Why
would that not work? Looking at the code, that seems to be how p2pdma
works today. The p2pdma provider does p2pdma_add_resource() on a chunk
of its memory, and the genalloc allocates memory from that chunk?

The actual issues I see with this approach are:

1. There is no way for the p2pdma provider to relinquish back the
memory it has provided via pci_p2pdma_add_resource(), in the case that
the user crashed or would like to free the GPU buffer. I would need to
add a pci_p2pdma_remove_resource(). Would that be  acceptable?

2. The p2pdma semantics seem to be global to the pci device. I.e., 1
GPU can export 1 p2pdma resource at a time (the way I'm reading the
API). This is not usable for my use case. I would need multiple users
to be able to use the uapi in step #1 simultaneously. I would need the
same pci device to export different p2pdma resources simultaneously
and the p2pdma clients would need to be able to import some of the
resources. I would likely need to add an api like this:

Looking for feedback from anyone knowledgeable, but the p2pdma
maintainers as well if possibl.

I think this comment is maybe a side effect of the misunderstanding.
In the proposal, the user allocates a GPU buffer using the API in step
#1, and then binds the memory to the NIC rx queue using the API
specified in step #2. We use flow steering & RSS to steer this user's
TCP traffic to the buffer owned by them.
