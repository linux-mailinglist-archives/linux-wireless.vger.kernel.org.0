So if I'm understanding the situation correctly Microchip's porting
guide[1] doesn't match with kernel.org documentation[2]? I'm not the
expert here but from my point of view the issue is clear: the code needs
to follow kernel.org documentation[2], not external documentation.

I'll add devicetree list so hopefully people there can comment also,
full patch available in [3].

Alexis, if there are no more comments I'm in favor submitting the revert
you mentioned.
