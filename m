Am I confused, or is the change [3] in the other direction?

From what I see, the code there (now changed again, btw) is about
reading the value *from the driver*.

The driver change is about getting the value *from the supplicant*.

And the _outgoing_ code (sending it to the driver) from the supplicant
has - as far as I can tell - been putting it into the attribute in host
byte order forever? See commit cfaab58007b4 ("nl80211: Connect API
support").


Aha! So, I'm not _completely_ confused, however, the only use of this
value in this driver is sending it back to the supplicant! Which seems
entirely wrong, since the supplicant assumes basically anything will be
handled?

(But - the firmware also has a parameter key_mgmt_suites [in struct
wilc_external_auth_param] which is never even set in
wilc_set_external_auth_param??)


Also note that the supplicant will *only* read RSN_AUTH_KEY_MGMT_SAE in
big endian, so you've already lost here pretty much?

I am wondering if it works at all ...

But this cannot be done! On input to the driver, the value is in host
byte order always. The question is on output - and there you cannot
detect it.

That might even work? Well, not the same fix, since again input vs.
output, but something like this:

but that doesn't actually work for anything other than
