I'm sorry, but "WARNING: ath11k PCI support is experimental!" and such 
occasional issues don't give me the best feeling that everything is 
operating as it should :)

Okay, that means that you should be able to reproduce 
pre-7fef431be9c9ac255838a9578331567b9dba4477 with page_alloc.shuffle=1 
as well ... it just might take a lot of tries to get a problematic page.

I could also imagine that loading the driver deferred, after quite some 
system/mm activity could result in the same issue.

Looks like something either cannot handle a specific address we received 
via dma_alloc_coherent(), or something is reading out of bounds, and the 
content after our allocated page doesn't have the expected value anymore 
(e.g., used to be zero, now no longer zero).

What puzzles me is that "err: 0". That should have been properly set by 
HW, no?
