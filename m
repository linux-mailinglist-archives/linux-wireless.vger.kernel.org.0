Hi,

During the weekend we updated wireless-next tree from v6.5 to v6.6-rc4+.
It looks like a new warning was enabled for v6.6 as I see with GCC 13.2
and W=1 several warnings (list below). In v6.5 wireless code was still
W=1 warning free with GCC.

For wireless we get lots of questionable cleanup patches. But actually
these kind of warnings are what we would prefer to be fixed instead of
the random churn we always see. Hence I'm sending this Request For Help
(RFH) in case the cleanup people would fix these. Is there a mailing
list I should send this to?

The sooner these are fixed the better, it makes it difficult for us to
see any new warnings from this noise.

Kalle
