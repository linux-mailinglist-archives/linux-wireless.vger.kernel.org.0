Hehe, indeed. It takes 0.2 seconds on my workstation, that's fast enough
for me :)

Thanks for the idea, I added this to ath12-check:

https://github.com/qca/qca-swiss-army-knife/commit/ef11ea4c7a866247f23f3d0825f9b08bd29c4989

So from now on I will always run kernel-doc for ath12k.

It's just that in my experience it's SO hard to get people reading
documentation, even something really small. I'm not really optimistic
that using kernel-doc in drivers is any different and people ignore that
as well, like any other documentation.

That's good to know. But in a way I understand why that style is not
used, at least the example in the link is hard to read.

But the existing style is to provide documentation only when it's
necessary. With kernel-doc we have to provide documentation when it's
not even needed, no? For example, if only one enum needs documentation
and all others obvious,

Ouch. But I'm surprised why nobody has reported these before? Are the
kernel-doc warnings ignored by everyone?

I have no problems changing the status quo but having extra work without
a clear benefit is my concern here.

Thanks. If you have time, maybe you could update ath11k-check and
ath10k-check? Every developer should use those scripts so having them
notice the warnings earlier is easier for everyone.
