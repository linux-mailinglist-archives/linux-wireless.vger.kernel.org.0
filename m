I got to this thread really late I guess :-)

But why would you disconnect the PCIe device just to power it down?!

That's kinda icky, IMHO.

Looks reasonable to me.

I guess if you absolutely know in software when the device is present or
not, you don't need "real" PCIe hotplug, just need to tickle the
software right?

Well, they said above it's a GPIO that controls it, so the software
already knows and doesn't really need an event?

But it depends on the hardware how this is handled, Intel NICs for
example just trigger an IRQ to the host and don't turn off much, for
them the W_DISABLE pin is just a GPIO in input mode, with edge triggered
interrupt to the driver.

I never heard of this. Which NICs are we talking about?

But you don't know which the rfkill device is, do you?

I mean, fundamentally, you just have a GPIO that turns on and off the
W_DISABLE pin. NICs will not generally disappear from the bus when
that's turned on, so you need a NIC driver integration.

I guess you also have an rfkill-gpio driver assigned to this GPIO, which
gets assigned there via DT/platform code?

Ah, but then I guess you could have a phandle in the DT or so that ties
the W_DISABLE-GPIO with the PCIe slot that it controls.

This I don't understand.

Oh, good point, no DT support here - so how *do* you actually
instantiate the rfkill today??

Right.

So, I'm not even sure we need the *driver* to do anything other than say
"I know the device will drop off the bus when rfkill is enabled", right?


But do we actually need rfkill to be involved here?

I mean, let's say first we make rfkill-gpio DT-aware, rather than just
ACPI. This should be simple. Then it drives a GPIO (it can actually
drive two and a clock, not sure I know why).

Now, next we need something that says that the device should be treated
as hotplug/unplug. We could make this in the driver somehow like you
suggested, but that seems like a lot of effort?

Couldn't we put this into the *GPIO* subsystem instead?

I mean - conceivably there could be GPIOs that just power down a device
for example. Not even through something like W_DISABLE, but just having
a GPIO hooked up to a transistor on the voltage pin of the device. That
would have very similar semantics?

So why not just attach the PCIe device/port to the GPIO, and have the
GPIO implementation here call the detach/attach (or detach/rescan?) when
they are toggled?

Not that I'd mind having it in rfkill! But it seems like a special case
to have it there, when you can do so much more with GPIOs.
