I'm not debating whether it's there or not -- I'm saying the _contents_ of
"nlattr::nla_len", in the face of corruption or lack of initialization,
may be less than NLA_HDRLEN. (There's a lot of "but that's can't happen"
that _does_ happen in the kernel, so I'm extra paranoid.)

Type confusion (usually due to Use-after-Free flaws) means that a memory
region is valid (i.e. good pointer), but that the contents might have
gotten changed through other means. (To see examples of this with
struct msg_msg, see: https://syst3mfailure.io/wall-of-perdition/)

(On a related note, why does nla_len start at 4 instead of 0? i.e. why
does it include the size of nlattr? That seems redundant based on the
same logic you're using here.)

My concern is that there are 562 callers of nla_len():

$ git grep '\bnla_len(\b' | wc -l
562

We have no way to be certain that all callers follow a successful
nla_ok() call.

Regardless, just moving from "int" to "u16" solves a bunch of value
range tracking pain that GCC appears to get upset about, so if you
really don't want the (tiny) sanity check, I can just send the u16
change.
