Subject: [PATCH 05/12] iwlwifi: mvm: don't change band on bound PHY contexts
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-wireless.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

When we have a P2P Device active, we attempt to only change the
PHY context it uses when we get a new remain-on-channel, if the
P2P Device is the only user of the PHY context.

This is fine if we're switching within a band, but if we're
switching bands then the switch implies a removal and re-add
of the PHY context, which isn't permitted by the firmware while
it's bound to an interface.

Fix the code to skip the unbind/release/... cycle only if the
band doesn't change (or we have old devices that can switch the
band on the fly as well.)
