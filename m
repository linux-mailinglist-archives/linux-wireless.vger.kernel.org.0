I wasn't trying to be glib here, sorry if it came across that way.  I'll
blame the heat...

No, well, yes.  See the zillion patches we have had to apply to the
kernel over the years when someone decided that "usb devices are not to
be trusted" that syzbot has helped find :)

It's not a DMA issue here, it's a "the protocol allows for buffer
overflows and does not seem to be able to be verified to prevent this"
from what I remember (it's been a year since I looked at this last,
details are hazy.)  At the time, I didn't see a way that it could be
fixed, hence this patch.

But yes, details matter, again I'll refrain from submitting this change
until I have those details.

thanks,
