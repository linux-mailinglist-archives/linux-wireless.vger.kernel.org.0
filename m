Sure, but we also had user reports of it *not* actually working (maybe
it regressed?). We didn't know whether it was functional with the
linux-firmware blobs in any way, I wanted confirmation of that. And we
also didn't know that the patch *would* break it at all; perhaps the
Cypress firmware had also grown support for the WSEC mechanism.

That's why I wanted someone to actually confirm the code worked (in some
subset of cases) and the patch didn't, before starting to introduce
conditionals. There is, of course, also the element that the Cypress
side has been long unmaintained, and if nobody is testing/giving
feedback/complaining, perhaps it's better to err on the side of maybe
breaking something and see if that gets someone to come out of the
woodwork if it really breaks, rather than tiptoeing around the code
without knowing what's going on and without anyone actually testing things.

It's not about this *specific* patch, it's about the general situation
of not being able to touch firmware interfaces "just in case Cypress
breaks" being unsustainable in the long term. I wasn't pushing back
because I think this particular one will be hard, I was pushing back
because I can read the tea leaves and see this is not going to end well
if it's the approach we start taking for everything. We *need* someone
to be testing patches on Cypress, we can't just "try not to touch it"
and cross our fingers. That just ends in disaster, we are not going to
succeed in not breaking it either way and it's going to make the driver
worse.
