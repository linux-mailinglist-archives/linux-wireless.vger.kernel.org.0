Kalle,

  Thanks so much for your and your teams efforts.  I've applied the
patch, and I'm receiving some errors similar to what you thought might
occur:

[    7.802756] ath11k_pci 0000:55:00.0: WARNING: ath11k PCI support is
experimental!
[    7.802797] ath11k_pci 0000:55:00.0: BAR 0: assigned [mem

result: 1, err: 48
[    8.172624] ath11k_pci 0000:55:00.0: qmi failed to respond fw mem req:-22

I've reverted the commit you mentioned and am rebuilding now.  I'll
test in a few minutes.

Thanks!
