Agree.

Well in mac80211 it's HZ/33, which is about the same time.

True.

Well I should have said time-travel=inf-cpu, which is really the mode
I'd use for testing (and we have time-travel=ext of course for use with
multiple VMs).

In this case it simulates infinite CPU speed! Thus time only passes if
it passes *explicitly*. So a timeout of 30ms will only fire after
something else has slept 30ms, or nothing is actually doing anything at
all of course. The amount of time it takes the CPU to do the jump out to
userspace/wmediumd, come back, copy the frame, etc. is all completely
irrelevant in this case. It's just "sleep 30ms" and all the necessary
CPU expenditure is not accounted at all.
