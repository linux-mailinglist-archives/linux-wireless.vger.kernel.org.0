We (the wireless folks) have been talking about dropping legacy drivers
on and off for several years now. The problem is that we don't know
which of them work and which not, for example IIRC someone reported
recently that wl3501 still works.

Personally I would be extremly happy to remove all the ancient drivers
as that reduces the amount of code for us to maintain but is that the
right thing to do for the users? I don't have an answer to that,
comments very welcome.

I have been also wondering if I should add warnings like this to every
ancient driver to see if there are any users left:

"wl3501 wireless driver will be removed in 2024. If the driver still
works and you are using it send a report NOW to
linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org to avoid the removal."

But with the long release cycles the kernel and distros have I doubt
waiting for a year is enough, it should be more like three years.
