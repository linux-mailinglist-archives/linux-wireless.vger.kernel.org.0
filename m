Sorry, I got confused - for some reason I was pretty sure something here
was already being added to units.h in this patchset.

Sure, and in this case that's probably pretty much equivalent. But
having a MHZ_TO_KHZ() macro isn't inherently *bad*, and I'm not sure
you're objection to it on anything other than "it's not defined in
units.h".

I just think that the better course of action would be to eventually
move MHZ_TO_KHZ() to units.h ...
