I think we need to qualify this "no regressions" "rule". People regress
our machines in mainline all the time. We catch it and get it fixed,
sometimes in RCs, sometimes it goes all the way to stable and needs to
get fixed there. We've had patches break everything from Bluetooth LE
pairing to core memory management to the point we needed earlycon to
diagnose it. That last one was a blatantly wrong patch to core Linux MM,
it wasn't even something specific to our platform, but even that got
past review (it just happened to break us specifically due to a
coincidence).

The review process doesn't magically avoid regressing things. "No
regressions" is impossible without someone actually testing things.
Claiming otherwise is dishonest. So if I end up as maintainer here I
certainly am not going to promise "no regressions" for chips I can't
test, without someone interested in those chips testing them. Of course
I'll take regression fixes when they do happen and someone notices, but
I can't know in advance until someone does.

Consider a patch that changes some codepath in the driver. I can't know
whether the original logic was always broken, or whether it worked on
some chips, and whether the new logic works on those chips or will
regress them, without testing. This is a regular occurrence with
brcmfmac, due to the complexity and variability of the firmware
interface. Often multiple versions of stuff are supported, or some
structures can be extended, but sometimes they can't. It's a mess, and
without firmware source code nor any official specs, there is no way to
know exactly what is intended and what the backwards compatibility
requirements are.

The only way to avoid that is to gratuitously introduce version/chip
gates for *every single change affecting behavior from the firmware
POV*, which is a complete non-starter and would quickly yield a giant
mess of spaghetti code. It's bad enough having to support explicit
ABI-breaking changes in firmware, and having to deal with multiple
versions of huge structures and convert between them. Trying to outright
keep existing logic identical for "other chips" is just not going to
happen, not without first having confirmation of what the requirements
are from someone who has the required docs/source.

I have a patch to enable WPA3 in Broadcom chipsets (yes, the driver is
in such a sorry state it doesn't even support that yet). The current
support attempt was added by a Cypress engineer and uses a completely
different firmware mechanism. Is that supposed to actually work? Does it
work currently? Is that the case for all Cypress firmwares? Or only
some? Does the alternate mechanism we have for Broadcom chips work too?
Only Cypress can answer those questions ahead of time, and they aren't
(they ignored me last time I brought this up). So my current patch just
replaces the mechanism with the known-working one for Broadcom chips.

Next time I send a bunch of our downstream patches, I'm going to resend
that WPA3 patch. And if it regresses Cypress WPA3 support, tough luck.
If someone catches it (Phil?) and it turns out the existing support is
the only way to do things on Cypress, I'll rework the patch to
conditionally support both styles. But if nobody does, and nobody cares,
then I'm sorry if I regress things, but there is no way to avoid it. We
can't be gratuitously gating every single change just to hope to avoid
regressions, without any confirmation of what is required. That just
doesn't scale.

Phil: Given Cypress' complete apathy towards this driver, if you want
the Cypress chips in Raspberry Pi systems to continue working and catch
potential problems ahead of time, it would be helpful if you can test
the patches in this branch. This is our downstream brcmfmac patchset.
Regardless of what ends up happening with the maintainer situation,
giving this a whirl will be very helpful in catching problems with
systems people actually use. It should be easy to bisect regressions too
(we keep this rebased directly on recent kernels so you can apply it on
top of your tree or whatever).
