Is that maybe a duplicate of this one:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217321

In that case it might make sense to test with a proposed fix for that
bug (that iirc is
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230911073352.3472918-1-mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com/
) to speed up fixing the rtw88 regression in case there is one.

Ciao, Thorsten
