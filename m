my point exactly. Tell me when the last hostap release was and how much
delta that has to HEAD. So the wpa_supplicant you have in Fedora is
essentially yet another fork of an upstream project. One of many.

Reality is there is limited interest to make WiFi great on Linux. And
if you really look honestly, then you realize it is pretty bad.
