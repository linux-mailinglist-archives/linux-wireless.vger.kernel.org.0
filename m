I try and then decide whether this is help or not.
	
If I remember correctly, support for PN547 was done by multiple parties for some Broadwell based designs through the upstream, both on the kernel and neard side.

Assuming the integration details of PN547 didnâ€™t deviate much, this might be:

- From relatively simple, i.e. getting the relevant data from ACPI and hinting the kernel/driver with a minimally sufficient changes. Most likely, once you sort the basic details (i2c, gpio, etc), everything would just work.

- To more laborious and would require a working and ideally open source reference. An option here might be Broadwell based Chromebooks with PN547 (just not sure whether plain or OEMs).

Regards,
Oleg
