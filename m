I did ask myself that too, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure - need
somebody more familiar to really understand that, I think.

Most places elsewhere _do_ call both, and it feels like you have to call
both if you want to do something with the device.

However there are a few places that seem to call the first part and then
remove the device again immediately after. That also seems harmless
though.

>=20

Unfortunately, there isn't such a place, since the scanning is done by
various bus walks.
