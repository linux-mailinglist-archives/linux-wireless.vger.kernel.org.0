So we don't even need HE overrides in this case?

Evidently, like maybe the spec was planning to add TWT to VHT or
something like that?

Maybe this can be done, but since TWT is in several different places, it
is going to be a pain to code up that way.

The way I see it, if we do go with overrides, the API is going to be pretty
tricky, basically passing a bunch of u8 around to represent different sets of IE
contents and their mask.  So I think it is cleaner to pass in specific flags such as 'disable-twt'.
Now, maybe those types of flags can be passed in as part of a nested netlink attribute
or a 'override-flags-1' u32 so that each time we add a new one it doesn't need to grow
the main netlink enum...

And, I'd still like to see a way to set station config
while it is still admin down, so that we have all of the desired local config overrides set
before we ever even start scanning...  That would be a better way to do overrides in
general in my opinion.

Thanks,
Ben
