Hello David,
thanks for your patch.

Please have a look at Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.
In very brief:
 - you should use imperative mood to describe your changes
 - this is fixing a real issue, I believe this is worth a more complete commit
   message, including a log of the failure this is solving.

I am also inclined to think that this change should be backported and it likely
would need a Fixes: tag.

from my understanding there is already a function polling for the firmware to be
active, e.g. mwifiex_check_fw_status(). Maybe is that function that needs to be
fixed instead of adding an additional delay here?
