Can we put this code in drivers/pci/pci.c instead of creating a new
file for it?  pci.c is kind of a dumping ground and isn't ideal
either, but we do have a few other things there that we *always* want
even though they're related to a separate Kconfig feature, e.g.,
pci_bridge_reconfigure_ltr(), pcie_clear_device_status(),
pcie_clear_root_pme_status().

>  obj-$(CONFIG_PCIEASPM)		+= aspm.o

Or maybe it would be better to just put it in aspm.c, drop this
compilation guard, and wrap the rest of the file in #ifdef
CONFIG_PCIEASPM.  Then everything would be in one file, which is a
major boon for code readers.

What do you think?

I think this is better than the previous situation, but I think we
should taint the kernel here because it's possible the firmware had a
reason for retaining ASPM control, so we might be stepping on
something.  Arguably the message is already enough of a signal, but
checking for a taint is potentially a little more automatable.

In this case, we don't care about the shift offset of the
PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_ASPMC bitfield, but if we use FIELD_GET() in most/all
other cases where we look at PCI_EXP_LNKCTL, maybe it would be worth
using it here as well?

Tangent, but I'm always dubious about the idea that e1000e is so
special that only there do we need the "_locked" variant of this
function.  No suggestion though; no need to do anything about it in
this series ;)
