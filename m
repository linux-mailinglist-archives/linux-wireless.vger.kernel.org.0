Thinking about it, you could probably just remove that call from the Xen 
DRM driver now anyway - since the dma-direct rework, we lost the ability 
to set dma_dummy_ops by default, and NULL ops now represent what it 
(presumably) wants.

There's also the in-between step of making of_dma_get_range() return a 
size based on all the dma-ranges entries rather than only the first one 
- otherwise, something like [1] can lead to pretty unworkable default 
masks. We implemented that when doing acpi_dma_get_range(), it's just 
that the OF counterpart never caught up.
