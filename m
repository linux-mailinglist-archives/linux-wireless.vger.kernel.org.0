Yeah, they're quite similar and seem to descend from the same codebase, 
but the APIs between the kernel driver and the firmware are very different.

One more thing that comes to mind after reading this discussion 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/eb555433-ade1-e89e-30e4-f4c1c24c25e7@gmail.com/ 
is that maybe the read-back is really only serving the purpose of a 
udelay(), so if you want you can try playing around with that a bit 
instead of the read-back.
