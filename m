I do see a couple other drivers that are completely inflexible (they
request min==max).  But I don't know the system constraint you're
hitting.  CC'd Thomas & Christoph in case they have time to give us a
hint.

Or you could just add linux-wireless, e.g.,

  L:      ath11k@lists.infradead.org
  L:      linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org

or even consider moving from ath10k and ath11k to
linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org.  I think there's some value in
consolidating low-volume lists.  It looks like ath11k had < 90
messages for all of October.
