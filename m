The standard is whatever we say it is and what exists in the wild...

Probably better for me to get the series posted for context, but the
above is removed because we could be passing in the bus device/child
node and checking for 'dma-ranges' rather than only the bus node.
While this does mean 'dma-ranges' could be in a child node which is
wrong, it simplifies the only caller of_dma_configure(). And really,
there's no way to detect that error. Someone could call
of_dma_configure(NULL, child, ...). Perhaps we could assert that
'ranges' is present whenever 'dma-ranges' is.

Back to the standard, I think it can be summarized as a device's
immediate parent (a bus node) must contain 'dma-ranges'. All the
parent nodes of the bus node should also have 'dma-ranges', but
missing is treated as empty (1:1 translation). 'dma-ranges' missing in
all the parent nodes is also treated as 1:1 translation and no
addressing restrictions.

Yes, sending it out soon.
