Hello Dear,

I got your contact through the internet due to serious searching for a
reliable personality.
Iam Mmamie Shimirah from Free Town Capital of Sierra Leone. Time of
opposed to the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kebbah the
ex-leader.

Since 21st November, 2005 But I am current residing here in Calavi
Benin Republic due to war of my country, my mother killed on
04/01/2002 for Sierra Leone civilian war my father decided to change
another residence country with me because I am only child for my
family bad news that my father passed away on 25/11/2018. During the
war, My father made a lot of money through the illegal sales of
Diamonds. To the tune of $10,200,000.

This money is currently and secretly kept in ECOWAS security company
in Porto-Novo Benin , but because of the political turmoil which still
exists here in Africa, I can not invest the money by myself, hence am
soliciting your help to help me take these funds into your custody and
also advise me on how to invest it.

And I want to add here that if agreed 35% of the total worth of the
fund will be yours minus your total expenses incurred during the
clearing of the fund here in
Porto Novo that if agreed 35% that's $3,570,000 I would like to invest
on heavy duty agricultural equipment and earth moving machines to
enable me go into a full scale mechanized farming.

I wait to hear from you soon as possible, my warm regards to you and
your family.
