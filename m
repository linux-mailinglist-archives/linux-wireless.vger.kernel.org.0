I think the rootcause of the original problem is that
1. on some systems, the ACPI RTC Fixed event is used during suspend
only, and the ACPI Fixed event is enabled in the rtc-cmos driver
.suspend() callback
and
2. if the RTC Alarm already expires before .suspend() invoked, we will
lose the ACPI RTC Fixed Event as well as the wakeup event, say 20
seconds delay in freeze processes.

But, even if that problem is fixed, the suspend aborts and "fails" as
expected, this is still a problem for the suspend-automation scenario,
because the system actually can suspend successfully if we don't set
the RTC alarm too aggressively. And in PCH overheating case, surely we
will get false alarms, because we will never use a 60s+ rtc alarm for
suspend-automation.

thanks,
rui
