Otherwise, NL80211_CMD_SET_PMK is not accepted. The only improvement would be to document this more clearly in the "WPA/WPA2 EAPOL handshake offload" DOC section in nl80211.h.

Hi Marcel,

You are right. However, the kernel does also return an error if the 
WARN_ON is hit. We can improve by using the EXT_ACK functionality to 
provide more info than just -EINVAL, eg. "PMK not accepted; no 802.1X 
offload requested on connect".

> Frankly, I donâ€™t get why nl80211 itself is not validating the input and this is left to the driver. I think we need a nl80211 fuzzer that really exercises this API with random values and parameters to provide invalid input.

That would mean nl80211 should keep state info between commands. From 
what I remember that has been avoided from day one because of the 
experiences with that in the WEXT days. I welcome any testing be it 
fuzzer or something else.

Regards,
Arend
