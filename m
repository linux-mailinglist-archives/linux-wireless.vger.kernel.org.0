My Dear friend.

With all due respect, I know this message will come to you as a
surprise, My name is Mr. Mohammad Ahmed a banker working with Bank of
Africa Du Burkina Faso West Africa, i need your urgent assistance to
transfer an abandoned Sum of 13.5 Millions USD into your account.

I am contacting you independently of my investigation in my bank and
no one is informed of this communication. I need your urgent
assistance to reallocate the sum of $13.5Million Dollars to Your
private account.

The fund in question belongs to one of my late foreign customer who
died a long time ago with his family in the plane crash year 2005.

The fund has been here in our bank coffers lying dormant for years now
without anybody coming to claim the fund as the late deceased Next of
Kin for none of his family relation are a wear of the fund in our
bank.

I want you to come and stand as the late deceased Next of Kin and
business partner to claim his balance in our bank no matter the
country you come from bank will release and transfer the fund into
your account and be rest assured to have my support during the claim
for I am the late deceased account officer before he met his sudden
death in the plane crash with his family on their way traveling to
Summer Holidays.

I am contacting you to come and claim the fund through my support as
the deceased account officer because the bank laws here does not allow
any inheritance fund to stay more than 16years in the bank coffers
without claiming by the concerned family for the money will be
recalled to the bank Treasury account as unclaimed funds.

I am ready to share with you 50% for you and 50% for me and by
indicating your interest and capability to execute the project with me
after reading message,  I will send you more details on how the fund
will be officially release and transfer in your account for the
transaction will be execute in your favor without any problem for the
only thing i want from you is to be honest with me during the
transaction official process.

I will be waiting for your urgent response after going through this
message to enable me feed you with more details for us to proceed
ahead.

Thanks.

Best Regards,


Mr. Mohammad Ahmed
