Perhaps what we need here is some sort of mechanism to make rfkill and
the PCI host controller interoperate? I could imagine for example that
the PCI host controller would get a new "rfkill" property in device
tree that points at the rfkill device via phandle.

The driver could then get a reference to it using something like:

	rfkill =3D rfkill_get(dev);
	if (IS_ERR(rfkill)) {
		...
	}

and register for notification:

	err =3D rfkill_subscribe(rfkill, callback);
	if (err < 0) {
		...
	}

rfkill_unsubscribe() and rfkill_put() would then be used upon driver
unload to detach from the rfkill.

I noticed that there's an rfkill-gpio driver (net/rfkill/rfkill-gpio.c)
that already does pretty much everything that we need, except that it
doesn't support DT yet, but I suspect that that's pretty easy to add.

Johannes, any thoughts on this. In a nutshell what we're trying to solve
here is devices that get removed from/added to PCI based on an rfkill-
type of device. The difference to other implementations is that we have
no way of detecting when the device has gone away (PCI hotplug does not
work). So we'd need some software-triggered mechanism to let the PCI
host controller know when the device is presumably going away or being
added back, so that the PCI bus can be rescanned and the PCI device
removed or added at that point).
