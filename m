The main problem for supporting that case in general is the disgusting 
carving up of the physical memory map you may have to do to guarantee 
that a single buffer allocation cannot ever span two windows with 
different offsets. I don't think we ever reached a conclusion on whether 
that was even achievable in practice.

Yeah, there's just no way for masks to describe that the device can 
drive all the individual bits, just not in certain combinations :(

The plan I have sketched out there is to merge dma_pfn_offset and 
bus_dma_mask into a "DMA range" descriptor, so we can then hang one or 
more of those off a device to properly cope with all these weird 
interconnects. Conceptually it feels pretty straightforward; I think 
most of the challenge is in implementing it efficiently. Plus there's 
the question of whether it could also subsume the dma_mask as well.

Robin.
