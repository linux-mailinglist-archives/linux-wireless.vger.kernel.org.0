Nothing is decided, I'm just proposing my patch as a cleanup
for now. It would be nice to still drop the ndo_do_ioctl function
though, at least in some form. When your driver actually makes
it into the kernel, you can find a different method of communicating
the address between the socket interface and the device driver.

I can see a few ways this could work out:

- add a custom callback pointer to struct atalk_iface to
  get and set the address for phase1 probing instead of going
  through the ioctl

- rewrite the probing logic in aarp.c more widely, and improve
  the userspace interface in the process by introducing a netlink
  interface

- Move your entire driver into userspace and go to the kernel
  using tun/tap. This has the added benefit of avoiding a lot
  of the complexity of the tty line discipline code you have.
