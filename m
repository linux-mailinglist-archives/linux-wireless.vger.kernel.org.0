Well, the comment says "most callers" :)

I think having an early return like this is perfectly valid
optimisation, even if it doesn't really make any performance difference.
I don't feel incredibly strongly about it (given that the current check
is broken I guess the early return has never actually worked), so if you
feel like overriding your submaintainer on this, feel free ;)
