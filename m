The real problem here is the missed wakeup events and I've already
said in this thread how this can be fixed and Rui appears to agree
with me.

So I'd say why don't we just go and fix it?

And it is orthogonal to the first 3 patches in this series, because
they move the PCH thermal delay to the noirq phase which is later than
the arming of the RTC Fixed Event IIUC.

We have tested "early" wakeups which is what the users would see on
the system in question if they set the RTC wake time to 1 second
before suspending.

This may not be what we want to test, though, but that is a different
problem, as discussed below.

So the goal specifically is to test the last phase of system suspend
and in particular whether or not the platform has reached the specific
minimum-power state at the end of it.

In order to do that, we basically want to ignore all of the wakeup
events except for the special RTC wakeup 1 second after the platform
has been asked to get into the minimum-power state, so what we are
talking about here really is a special suspend test mode using the RTC
as a wakeup vehicle.
