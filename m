I'm not sure how hostapd treats NO-IR, but even ibss seems likely to be
off limits given the wording as it is still a point-to-point mode. NO-IR
is the only thing which restricts active scanning or ibss in the kernel.
If it also restricts AP mode in hostapd, then we currently have no flag
to enforce passive scanning without also restricting AP mode.

And yes, PTMP-ONLY is essentially unused in the kernel so it likely has
no real impact.

Thanks,
Seth
