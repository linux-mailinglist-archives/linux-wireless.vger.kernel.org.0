Hmm, I originally thought the bandwidth determination would need to 
happen within the driver,  since itâ€™s required at the time of packet 
transmission for each mesh STA. The assumption was partly influenced by 
our existing firmware design.

But yeah, since the bandwidth doesnâ€™t really change much across PPDUs 
for the same STA, it actually makes more sense to handle it in mac80211 
and drivers can use it.

Yes that's right, the intersection and BW selection is done for every 
PPDU at Firmware.

When not considering CSA scenario then the puncturing pattern is an 
intersection of the local channel def and puncturing pattern advertised 
by peer.

If the local and peer mesh are capable of EHT, the negotiated EHT 
bandwidth of the peer mesh is considered first. The intersection of 
puncturing patterns is then applied on top of this to derive 
bandwidthâ€”potentially reduced and with or without additional puncturing.

> the bitmap changes? Why does userspace track it rather than mac80211,

When a channel switch is triggered by a userspace application,
the user space is fully aware of the bitmap changes and pass them to the 
mac80211 driver.
But when a peer mesh initiates a channel switch via CSA, the mac80211 
driver on the local mesh receives bitmap changes through CSA 
beacon/action frames and processes the channel changes internally.

However, unless the new bitmap is explicitly forwarded to userspace, the 
userspace component might not be aware of the bitmap changes.

I am thinking something like below for CSA with puncturing in Mesh,
1. Acquire the puncturing bitmap from the peer initiating the CSA action 
/ beacon frame.
2. Validate the new channel's compatibility with the new puncturing 
pattern, and apply the new channel context.
3. Forward the csa beacon/CSA action.
4. Reset the existing bitmap and apply the new bitmap to associated STAs.

I didn't take care of this in the patch series. I am planning to address 
this in the upcoming series

No, certainly not Johannes! ðŸ˜Š
I initially assumed the bandwidth would need to be decided by the driver 
  since itâ€™s tied to packet transmission for each mesh STAâ€” thatâ€™s kind of
how the firmware seemed to be built.
