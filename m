Nice, I only have this WILC3000 SDIO device .

I think I have a separate patch for this, one which folds 
wilc_get_chipid() entirely into wlan.c , and then follow up which uses 
is_wilc1000() / is_wilc3000() all over the place to discern the two MACs 
based on cached chip ID . That should work, I'll test it and submit it 
later today I hope.

I am now validating whether the hardware is either wilc1000 or wilc3000 
up front based on the chip ID early in init, so no other option can 
occur here, so there is no need for fallback, it is either wilc1000 or 
wilc3000 now (*). I think keeping them ordered alphanumerically is the 
nicer option.

Right, done.

I agree the code is ugly. Looking at the roadmap, it seems the next 
thing is WILCS02 which has its own driver, and for the WILC1000/3000 
inherited from atmel this seems to be the end of the road.

I did something like that for KSZ8851, that had bus-specific ops. I 
vaguely recall there was feedback that the function pointer indirection 
had non-trivial overhead due to spectre mitigations, and in case of the 
handle_txq() here, the chip specific ops would be called in a while() {} 
loop.

I can imagine some of the long functions like wilc_sdio_clear_int_ext or 
the handle_txq could be split up a bit, but likely only by factoring out 
some of the code into static functions. But looking at this closer, both 
pieces which are wilc1000/3000 specific in those functions manipulate 
with variables which would have to be passed in into that factored out 
code as function arguments, so I am not sure if this would improve 
readability by much either.
