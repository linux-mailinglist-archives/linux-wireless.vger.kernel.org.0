Thank you for being the first person to actually test any of this :)

Now we actually have a reason to keep the code. The next thing I wonder
is whether any of the *other* Cypress chips will respond to WSEC (in
addition to or instead of sae_password)...

Are you willing to test all the other wifi stuff we have queued up
downstream? There's a whole pile of changes here:

https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/commits/bits/080-wifi/

If things break it would be very helpful if you could bisect it down to
the specific commit. This patch is also in there of course, feel free to
revert/rebase it out.
