We are not asking to send the patches as single email. We are asking to
run git send-email only _once_ per patchset to make sure threading is
correct (ie. References and In-Reply-to headers are set). For example,
you can do it like this:

$ git format-patch --base=auto --cover-letter -o outgoing/ main
outgoing/0000-cover-letter.patch
outgoing/0001-First-Commit.patch
outgoing/...

$ git send-email [...] outgoing/
