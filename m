I can't access the logs after I hit this bug (e.g. as there are no
interrupts received from the keyboard) but when I trigger this from the
console, there is nothing logged when the hang happens.

Later, secondary errors are logged from other drivers that are no longer
receiving interrupts either, and RCU detects a stall as I mentioned
elsewhere.
