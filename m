Right.

Right.

So ... rfkill has some terminology issues sometimes. Let me clarify what
typically happens.

Usually, you have the rfkill instance "wiphy-xyz" which is on the
wireless NIC (through cfg80211). This has two things:

 1) software rfkill *control*
 2) hardware rfkill *reporting*

So a device like iwlwifi has software rfkill control through rfkill
"wiphy-phy0", which is really just implemented as "bring down all the
netdevs etc.". And then you have "HW rfkill reporting", where our NIC
just reports the current status of the W_DISABLE pin. This again causes
the software to turn off all the netdevs etc.

This is how it looks like for the *device* side.

Now, for the *platform* side, which we're really looking at now, we
usually have the rfkill be a bit differently:

hardware rfkill *reporting* isn't used at all here.

software rfkill *control*, instead of directly controlling the netdevs
etc. like the instances in cfg80211 do, this just controls the GPIO.


Now, in a typical platform with an Intel NIC, you have something like

platform rfkill device
 --> controls GPIO
  W_DISABLE pin
   --> reported as HW rfkill
    --> rfkill-wiphy0 device

In some other platforms, you literally just have a hardware button:

hardware button
 --> controls GPIO
  ... as before ...

Now, this all works great, but is basically software only, just using
the hardware pins as a communication mechanism.


Now, with some platforms, and particularly with BT USB devices where
I've seen this a lot (but never saw it with PCIe before), you have what
you're describing here, that the device just drops off the bus for an
rfkill.

Again, though, the actual cause of this might be a GPIO control (through
an rfkill instance) or something else like a literal hardware button
(not uncommon for Bluetooth).

Yeah, but the question is if we really need it from *rfkill* rather than
the GPIO as I described below?

See above.

Ok. Not sure we need much involvement of the driver and/or the rfkill
even though.

OK.

Right, but does it matter?

I mean - does this have a different impact on the software? It seems to
me one way or the other all you really need to do is hot-unplug a device
on the right signal one way, and rescan for devices on the other signal?

Hmm, sort of I guess. I think you need *both* associations really.

On the "disappear" transition, you need it to be linked to a very
specific device. On the "appear" transition, you need the rescan of the
root port right?

Depends. If you're talking about rfkill, you have a completely separate
rfkill-gpio device (the "platform rfkill device" I was talking about
earlier), and the driver for the actual wifi NIC isn't actually involved
at all.

Sure, I get that, but I still don't understand why we should link it to
the rfkill rather than the GPIO?

I mean, if we have these things in the platform/DT:

 WIFI-WDISABLE-GPIO
 WIFI-NIC-PCIE
 PCIE-ROOT-PORT
 PLATFORM-WIFI-RFKILL

then we'd describe the

  PLATFORM-WIFI-RFKILL as an rfkill-gpio using the WIFI-WDISABLE-GPIO

and make some sort of link:

 WIFI-WDISABLE-GPIO --enable-rescan-- PCIE-ROOT-PORT
                    --unplug-device-- WIFI-NIC-PCIE

or not?
