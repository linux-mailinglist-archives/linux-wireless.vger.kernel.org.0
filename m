The problem of "File:" is that it's more or less intended to be
installed as the firmware files themselves, i.e. they are installed in
/lib/firmware/* that can be loaded to the kernel.  Putting such a
random (document) file there makes me a bit nervous.

We may introduce another tag to list up misc document files
(e.g. "Doc:" or whatever)?  Distros can pick up them and put to the
appropriate places in the package, too.
