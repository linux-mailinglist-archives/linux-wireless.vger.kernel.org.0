Thank you very much! I will try to make my patch ready to be submitted =
soon, and I will add the proper reverts if needed.

I will experiment with this too, as it will require a bit of work to =
morph localtalk packets to ethertalk/aarp ones, and the code in the =
kernel has some specialized bits for localtalk here and there.

In any case, many thanks!
