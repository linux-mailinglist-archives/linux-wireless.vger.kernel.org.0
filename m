Good Day Dear!!!

I am Mrs. Dale K. Norris from Texas, United State Of America, presently
staying in London, United Kingdom. I am married to Engr. Chalmers Norris
who worked as the financial director under United Nation Development
Programme for Africa for more than ten years before he died in the year
2010. We were married for eleven years without a child, he died after a
brief illness that lasted for only four days and before his death we were
both born again Christian.

Since the death of my husband, I decided not to remarry or get a child
outside my matrimonial home as it's against the biblical belief of the
Christendom. When my husband was alive he deposited $12.5 Million USD with
a reputable bank, and presently this money is still with the bank;
recently, my doctor told me that I would not last long due to my cancer
problem and the one that disturbs me most is my partial paralysis.

I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for
Orphanages, Widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the
house of God is maintained. The Bible made us understand that blessed is
the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don’t have any child
or close relative that will inherit this money as I was raised as an
orphan and my husband relatives are not Christians, they even have a hand
in husband's death and I don’t want my husband’s efforts to be used by the
same people. This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of
death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the
bosom of the Lord. (Exodus 14 vs. 14) says that the Lord will fight my
case and I shall hold my peace.

As soon as I receive your reply with a guaranteed word to help me fulfill
the wish of my late husband, I will communicate with you the details of
the said funds and how its ownership will be communicated to you as the
sole beneficiary to that account.


Yours in Christ,
Mrs. Dale Karla Norris
