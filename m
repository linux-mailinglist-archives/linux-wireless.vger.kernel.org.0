This series introduces simple modifications to the Marvell mwifiex
wireless driver to make it support the SD8777 chipset which can be found
in mobile devices using the PXA1908 SoC (the support for which is being
upstreamed here [1]), among others, such as samsung,coreprimevelte or
samsung,xcover3lte. The changes are based on the Samsung downstream code
for coreprimevelte [2].

The driver requires proprietary firmware which is not yet part of
linux-firmware, but it is packaged in postmarketOS.

The Marvell repository for PXA1908 [3] contains some information in the
form of release notes (in a PDF under drivers/marvell/sd8777).

This series was sucessfully tested with the aforementioned smartphone,
samsung,coreprimevelte. However it has a caveat: the driver is not
always able to load the firmware onto the device and even when it
succeeds, it emits some errors and eventually breaks irrecoverably after
some time, seemingly after heavier usage. dmesg outputs with description
are below. The suspicion, supported by the fact that the eMMC on the
smartphone does not work at the moment (it reports as busy and the
initialization fails with -ETIMEDOUT, see [4] for dmesg output), is that
the problem is either with the MMC driver (sdhci-pxav3) or the clocks
driver which according to the author is currently missing some parts
present in the downstream version. In particular, the lack of tuning in
the mainline sdhci-pxav3 was considered a possible cause (specifically
the dvfs tuning which the downstream driver performs), however disabling
of this tuning in the downstream kernel doesn't seem to have any effect
on it's ability to use either eMMC or the wireless.

Here are the relevant dmesg outputs for several situations (debug
messages are enabled in the first, not so in the others):

This is the usual output when the firmware loading fails. The device has
to be rebooted before the next attempt to load the firmware because the
driver seems to think that it's already loaded.

The return value of mwifiex_write_data_sync which is invoked during the
firmware loading is -EILSEQ.

Here, the download succeeds but the driver still emits some errors.
Eventually after some (short in this case) time the wireless stops
working and the below errors are printed repeatedly (here the failure
occurred while page loading was in progress in Mozilla Firefox). A
restart seems to be necessary to get the adapter to work again.

Last observed scenario is again a failure occuring some time after
firmware loading succeeds. This also seems to be irrecoverable without
device reboot.

Despite these problems, the wireless is overall usable on the phone,
once the firmware loading succeeds, even for intensive transfers, until
one of the other failures occurs, for which no rule seems to exist - it
can happen soon after starting some transfer or it can work for several
hours under normal load, although some CMD_RESP errors (as above) are
printed frequently.
