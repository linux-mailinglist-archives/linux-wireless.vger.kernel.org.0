Interrupt remapping only helps when the device supports only MSI (not
MSI-X) because x86 (kernel) does not support multiple MSI interrupts
without remapping.

So if only MSI is available then you get exactly _one_ MSI vector
without remapping.

The config alone does not help. The hardware has to support it and the
BIOS has to enable it.

Check the BIOS for a switch which is named 'VT-d' or such. It might
depend on 'Intel Virtualization Technology' or such.

So I grabbed the PCI info from the link and it has:

     Capabilities: [50] MSI: Enable- Count=1/32 Maskable+ 64bit-

So no MSI-X, ergo only one MSI interrupt without remapping.

Right, even most high end network cards work with one interrupt.

Great design.

Can I have a full dmesg please?

Please enable CONFIG_IRQ_REMAP and CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU (not strictly
required, but it's a Dell BIOS after all). Also set
CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU_DEFAULT_ON.

Or simply try a distro kernel.

Thanks,
