Hi Stephen,

We are experimenting how we could take "next-next" patches during merge
windows and avoid accumulation of patches for the period which is in
practice three weeks for wireless patches. To do that could you please
change linux-next to pull from wireless trees for-next branches instead
of main branches? So the new locations are:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wireless/wireless.git for-next
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wireless/wireless-next.git for-next

The idea we have is that wireless-next for-next branch is not updated
during the merge window and then the "next-next" patches will not be
included in linux-next until the merge window has closed.
