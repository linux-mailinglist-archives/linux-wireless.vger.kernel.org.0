It's Debian Bookworm (testing) which comes with 6.1.20, however, the
card is not recognized, thus why I started messing with it.  I tried the
latest Xanmod kernel as well before I started diving into source in
6.3-rc4 (which also didn't recognize the card as shipped). I couldn't
find any reference to the PCI ID in the source either, which made sense
as to why it wouldn't be recognized.
