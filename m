Sure, but it's only a workaround as the underlying cause has not been
identified.

It sounds to me like the driver's locking is broken if moving to softirq
processing hangs the machine like this. But I have not had time to try
to try to track it down besides verifying that reenabling threaded NAPI
makes the problem go away.
