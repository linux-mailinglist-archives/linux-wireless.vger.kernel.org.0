I'm sorry, when I saw the v3 patch I realized that I forgot to reply to
this email. I had wanted to take a look at the kernel source to try and
understand the behavior you described.

I took a quick look, and from what I'm seeing the minimum of the power
limits for the two ranges should be used. This is the behavior I expect.
Can you provide more detail about how you're getting that result?

Thanks,
Seth
