Oh ok, serves me right for not looking thoroughly googling this first.
Alban Bedel and Ansuel's work made this nvmem all possible. And indeed,
the second patch here looks eerie similar.

Do you want to go with his two patches instead? I'll change mine, so it
just consists of the cal_mode for the older QCA9880v2,QCA9887 and
add the -EPROBE_DEFER handling. This -EPROBE_DEFER only ever comes up
with the Meraki gear. This is because Meraki likes putting the MACs-Values
into SoC-connected AT24 eeproms-chips. Everyone else just have them in a
proper FLASH partition. Though, this's usually nothing more than adding
the following line:

if (ret == -EPROBER_DEFER)
	return ret;

The nvmem api is there (which makes these two patches obsolete I think).
Granted: The nvmem can't do all the same cases (From what I know, mtd
partitions splitters and mtdparts through commandline is being worked on.
But we always have userspace + firmware_request as a fallback).
