I ended up just sending out a patch that does a full revert:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20240313233227.56391-1-ebiggers@kernel.org

Again, regardless of that, these issues with iwd have been recurring, and it is
still worth discussing the best way from a technical perspective to prevent them
from happening in the future...  There's a fairly clear path to achieve that.
