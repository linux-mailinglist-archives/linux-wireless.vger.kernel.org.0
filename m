Hello Dear,
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am Mrs. Francios Kone, Telex director, Central Bank of Burkina Faso.

I was mandated to contact you in the respect to overdue payment
reserved for you. Actually, during the October UN and AU bilateral
meeting focused on joint efforts to eradicate scam in Africa, the
security watchdog were set up and inaugurated in Addis Ababa, and
following the huge amount of money approved by the UN/AU for the
purpose of compensating some affected foreigners, it was decided that
BANK OF AFRICA will be in charge of transmitting the fund into the
account of the respective beneficiaries while the Central Bank of West
Africa Burkina Faso will oversee the payment exercises.

 The $2.6b offset by the UN is meant to repay and compensate the
detected victims of scam and some foreign contractors who executed
contracts in Africa and were not paid. In a nutshell, my department
was appointed to oversee the payment exercise. Having seen that your
email was among the emails in the list of the categories of people
selected to benefit $5.8 Million each as compensation, you are advised
to quickly send the below details to enable us set up your payment
files and forward the said files to the Bank of Africa remittance
department for immediate transfer of your compensation benefits.
