[ Upstream commit ef115c265a21e3c11deee7f73bd1061775a7bf20 ]

spin_lock/spin_unlock are used in ath12k_reg_chan_list_event
to acquire/release ab->base_lock. For now this is safe because
that function is only called in soft IRQ context.

But ath12k_reg_chan_list_event() will be called from process
context in an upcoming patch, and this can result in a deadlock
if ab->base_lock is acquired in process context and then soft
IRQ occurs on the same CPU and tries to acquire that lock.

Fix it by using spin_lock_bh and spin_unlock_bh instead.

Perfect! Now I can see the exact commit that matches the one being
analyzed. This commit was indeed applied on April 18, 2025 (which is
future-dated - this indicates this is a development/integration commit).
Based on the analysis: **YES** This commit should be backported to
stable kernel trees for the following reasons: 1. **Critical Deadlock
Fix**: The commit fixes a potential deadlock scenario involving the
`ab->base_lock` spinlock, which is identical to several previously
backported commits (Similar Commits #1, #2, #3, and #5 were all marked
as "YES" for backporting). 2. **Consistent Pattern**: The fix follows
the exact same pattern as the ath11k deadlock fixes that were
successfully backported. The issue is that `spin_lock()` was being used
in a context where soft IRQs could still occur, creating a deadlock
possibility when the same lock is acquired from both process and soft
IRQ contexts. 3. **Minimal and Safe Change**: The fix involves only
changing `spin_lock(&ab->base_lock)` to `spin_lock_bh(&ab->base_lock)`
and `spin_unlock(&ab->base_lock)` to `spin_unlock_bh(&ab->base_lock)` in
the `ath12k_reg_chan_list_event()` function - just 2 lines changed,
making it very low risk. 4. **Well-Understood Issue**: The commit
message clearly explains the deadlock scenario: when `ab->base_lock` is
acquired in process context and then a soft IRQ tries to acquire the
same lock on the same CPU, a deadlock occurs. Using `_bh` variants
prevents soft IRQs from interrupting the critical section. 5.
**Preventive Fix**: While the commit mentions "this will be called from
process context in an upcoming patch," the fix is preventive and
eliminates a race condition that could theoretically occur even in
current code paths. 6. **Critical Subsystem**: This affects the ath12k
wireless driver's regulatory channel list handling, which is a critical
path for wireless functionality. 7. **Established Precedent**: Similar
commits (#1, #2, #3, #5) with identical locking issues in ath11k,
ath12k, and mac80211 were all marked for backporting, establishing a
clear precedent that such deadlock fixes are appropriate for stable
trees. The change is contained, low-risk, fixes a critical locking
issue, and follows the stable tree guidelines for important bugfixes
with minimal regression risk.
