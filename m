bcmflags was previously an implied padding byte. If you actually check
the offsets of the subsequent fields, you'll see they haven't changed.
In fact this was added at some point in the past and just missing here,
and is a general case of "padding bytes were not explicitly specified"
which is arguably an anti-pattern and should never have been the case.

Had all the padding been specified correctly from the get go, it would
have been clear that this field was taking over an existing padding
byte, not adding anything nor shifting the offsets of subsequent fields.
