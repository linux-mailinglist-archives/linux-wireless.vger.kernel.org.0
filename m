From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

We found that that the following race is possible if userspace
enables runtime PM/auto-suspend immediately when a device shows
up in sysfs, if there's any call to pci_rescan_bus() during
normal system state (i.e. userspace is already active):

 - we rescan the PCI bus (*)
 - this creates the new PCI device including its sysfs
   representation
 - udev sees the new device, and the (OS-specific) scripting
   enables runtime PM by writing to power/control; this can
   happen _before_ the next step - this will runtime-suspend
   the device which saves the config space, including the BARs
   that weren't assigned yet
 - the bus rescan assigns resources to the devices and writes
   them to the config space of the device
   (but not the runtime-pm saved copy, course)
 - the driver binds and this disallows runtime PM, so the device
   is resumed, restoring the (incomplete!) config space
 - the device cannot work due to BARs not being configured

Fix this by allowing runtime PM only once the device has been
fully added. Also, with a warning, reject runtime PM on a not-
added device; this shouldn't happen anymore now.

Note that the comment that was there (that I'm replacing) was
indicating that pci_device_add() wouldn't be called at this
place yet, but in fact it's called much earlier during the whole
scan/probe process, which in part causes this problem, but it
doesn't seem possible to defer it until here either.

(*) In the case we encountered, this happened due to some reset
    of the iwlwifi device that the driver then needs to recover
    from by rescanning the bus since the device was reset and
    the system doesn't know about it yet.
