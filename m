We have a patch to hack the driver to allow one or the other with new
firmware.  Can post a version for 5.19 kernel soon, and we'll rebase on
something newer at some point soon.

Looks like root cause is that the mtk firmware added restrictions and cannot
be made to properly calibrate on both bands without a reboot.

Thanks,
Ben
