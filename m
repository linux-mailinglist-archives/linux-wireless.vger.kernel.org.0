It's a side-effect of asserting that W_DISABLE pin that the bus link
basically goes down. We've had a similar case recently, one that we
haven't quite solved either, where an RTL8169 Ethernet controller is
hooked up to a GPIO that controls the ISOLATEB (I think that was the
name) pin. If that pin is asserted, according to the documentation,
the device stops sampling/driving the PCI signals. So for all intents
and purposes it becomes disconnected.

We could kind of deal with this if the ISOLATEB was deasserted at probe
time, because that would mean that the device is at least enumerated on
PCI. Then when we go into some power down mode (for example when the
interface is taken down), the NIC driver could assert the GPIO and on
resuming from the power down mode deassert it again. Logically the
device would stay around, we just couldn't talk to it over PCI until the
driver has deasserted the ISOLATEB GPIO.

The problem is that it's not exactly defined what the status of the pin
would be at probe time. If it is asserted, the NIC will never show up on
the PCI bus and hence no driver would be registered that could deassert
the ISOLATEB signal. Well, unless we somehow created a "placeholder" PCI
device based on a device tree node (containing a reference to the GPIO)
so that the device would be enumerated (and probed) regardless of the
PCI link. There's no infrastructure to do that currently, but perhaps
worth investigating.

I think the W_DISABLE is somewhat similar. From what Manikanta was
saying, the PCI link also goes down when the pin is asserted, so we
loose any means of communicating with it over PCI.

The issue that Manikanta was trying to solve with this particular patch
was that since the PCI device is part of the PCI device hierarchy, some
userspace tools (X server, for example) will see it and try to discover
whether it's a GPU or not. This in turn causes errors from the PCI host
controller because it's trying to access a device behind a link that's
down. That, I assume, could also happen for the ISOLATEB case that I was
describing above, though it hasn't been brought up, I think.

Isn't that kind of the point of rfkill? I seem to remember having a
notebook where this was done exactly the same way. There was also a
button/switch that you could push which would result in the WiFi device
either going away completely or at the least loosing the WiFi link. It
seems like that's exactly what Manikanta is describing.

We still need to communicate from rfkill to the PCI host controller that
something happened, since they are two different entities.

Okay, so does this mean you have some input device connected to the WiFi
device that will be used (without software intervention) to disable the
transmitter and then the WiFi device will signal using the W_DISABLE pin
that the transmitter was indeed disabled?

I think that's the main problem that we're trying to solve. In our case
it does seem like the device completely disappears from the bus.

Yes, I think that's correct. Manikanta, please confirm.

Right, that's what I was thinking.

This was just an example of what I was imagining. The network driver
would get an rfkill (looked up via device tree phandle) and subscribe to
receive events from it, so that it could be notified when the rfkill is
"blocked" and rescan the bus to get the WiFi device unplugged. Once
unblocked it would be notified again and rescan the bus so that the
device would reappear.

I suspect that we've got downstream patches for that. The patch here is
part of a series to upstream support for this. I haven't seen the patch
for rfkill-gpio, but perhaps that's queued for later.

Yeah, that's where things become a little muddy. For the ISOLATEB case
there was initially a similar proposal. The problem is that on one hand
we can have different semantics for these pins. On one platform this
could be a kind of "power" GPIO, on others it could be ISOLATE/DISABLE,
and on yet others it would be more like a reset. In order to make the
PCIe port aware of the differences we'd have to expose multiple GPIOs in
DT for context.

The other problem with this is that, in order to avoid the chicken-and-
egg problem, we need to associate these GPIOs with the root ports,
because those are the only ones that exist at probe time. All downstream
devices may not be available because the power/reset/disable pin is not
asserted/deasserted yet. Now, you could potentially have a switch in the
downstream hierarchy, so it becomes completely unclear what exact device
the GPIO is associated with.

Related to that, a GPIO like this is really only useful if you can make
use of it. For example you want to assert/deassert this GPIO in order to
put the WiFi/Ethernet/whatever device into a low-power mode when it is
not used, right? But in order to do so, the driver for that device needs
to be able to handle the GPIO, because it is the only one that knows the
right point in time to toggle it. Conversely, if this was associated
with the root port, the only point in time where the root port driver
could toggle it is on a suspend/resume of the entire bus, which makes it
rather useless.

But then we're back to square one where we basically have to associate
the GPIO with the specific device. I think that's the right thing to do
because, well, that's what reality is. The GPIO is directly routed to a
pin on the chip. It's not something that goes over the PCI connector or
anything. However, we're also back to the chicken-and-egg problem since
without toggling the GPIO the device might not even get enumerated.

rfkill-gpio has the advantage that it decouples this and gets us out of
the chicken-and-egg situation. It also has fairly well-defined semantics
and fits the use-case, so it's a very appealing option.
