Good to know that the bridge shouldn't be the problem. Do you have any
ideas how to make more vectors available to ath11k, besides
CONFIG_IRQ_REMAP? Because QCA6390 works in Windows I doubt this is a
hardware problem.

True, this should be cleaned up. But of course this won't solve the
actual problem.

This was my first reaction as well when I saw the code for the first
time. And the reply I got is that the firmware needs all 32 vectors, it
won't work with less.

Good point, actually I have not. I'll add both ath10k and ath11k lists
to lore. It's even more important now that lists.infradead.org had a
hard drive crash and lost years of archives.

Thanks for the help!
