Stuff in drivers/staging/ is to get code _into_ the main portion of the
kernel tree, not out.  If these aren't being used, let's just drop them
entirely.

What is the need to have them move to staging, only to have me delete
them in the next release after that (or after that?)  Why delay and why
not just remove them now?

thanks,
