Yes I too think it is good to remove ndo_do_ioctl, I designed the =
TashTalk driver to be a drop-in replacement for COPS mostly for =
compatibility with netatalk 2.2. My plan was to propose it like this (so =
nothing else needed to be changed) and the propose some patches in the =
kernel part and userspace part (netatalk).

This was my initial thought, at least for the moment, mostly to keep =
netatalk happy and make sure I don=E2=80=99t break other stuff that =
makes assumptions on how the address probing worked. There are other =
bits I would like to improve, for example tcpdump (which parses =
correctly appetalk packets!) is broken in the current implementation.

This is sorta the =E2=80=9Csecond step=E2=80=9D I was planning, I think =
the logic for probing could be redesigned and simplified (it also does =
not work 100% correctly), and it could be a good chance to improve the =
interface with netatalk too.

We had some discussion too if to just make the lt an userspace stack, I =
personally like how it is currently implemented because existing code =
can run basically without modification.

I would propose at this stage to change the TashTalk driver to remove =
ndo_do_ioctl and to use a custom callback, if this ok.

Many thanks,
Rodolfo
