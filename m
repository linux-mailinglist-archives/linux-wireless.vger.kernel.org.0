Of course we can implement it (and we will as we actually got a report
of this patch breaking Cypress now, finally).

The question was never whether it could be done, we're already doing a
bunch of abstractions to deal with just the Broadcom-only side of things
too. The point I was trying to make is that we need to *know* what
firmware abstractions we need and *why* they are needed. We can't just
say, for every change, "well, nobody knows if the existing code works or
not, so let's just add an abstraction just in case the change breaks
something". As far as anyone involved in the discussions until now could
tell, this code was just something some Cypress person dumped upstream,
and nobody involved was being responsive to any of our inquiries, so
there was no way to be certain it worked at all, whether it was
supported in public firmware, or anything else.

*Now* that we know the existing code is actually functional and not just
dead/broken, and that the WSEC approach is conversely not functional on
the Cypress firmwares, it makes sense to introduce an abstraction.

Here's an example of the case where an abstraction was *not* needed: I
switched over WPA PSK configuration from hex-encoded to binary. That was
needed to make more recent Apple firmwares work. My evidence at the time
that that change *was* at least fairly backwards compatible was that the
OpenBSD driver had been doing it that way all along. Had we introduced
an abstraction/conditional for that case "just in case", it would have
generated superfluous technical debt for no reason.
