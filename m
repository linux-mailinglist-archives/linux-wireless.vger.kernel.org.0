The current quirk complicates the ASPM code.  I'm hoping that if we
set the bridge's Target Link Speed during enumeration, the link
retrain will "just work" without complicating the ASPM code.

An enumeration quirk wouldn't have to set the bridge's TLS to 2.5
GT/s; the quirk would be attached to specific endpoint devices and
could set the bridge's TLS to whatever the endpoint supports.

If there's a specific bug with a real root-cause analysis, please cite
it.  The threads mentioned in the current commit log are basically
informed speculation.
