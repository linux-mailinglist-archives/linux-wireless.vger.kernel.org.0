I do not think Kalle was claiming that. Regression will happen as it is 
simply not possible to verify each patch on all devices supported by the 
driver.

This is mainly why I introduced the vendor-split concept so we can keep 
the Cypress mechanism and allow a different mechanism for Broadcom 
chips. The Cypress mechanism did not work for the Broadcom chips I have 
so I wanted to test it on the Cypress chips I got shipped long ago and 
they simply do not come up. Have not tried with RPi as it is not running 
vanilla kernel. Could try with a backports driver.

The "no regressions" rule is an important one throughout the kernel. 
Trying to avoid it makes sense, but I have to agree that for brcmfmac 
there is not enough coverage to give any guarantee. As long you are 
prepared to fix things when a regression report comes in that should be 
fine depending on how often there is a need to revert/fix things as it 
can disrupt the normal flow of patches.

Arend
