WCN6750 is non-DBS 2x2 11AX chipset. Unlike QCA6390/WCN6855 which
are DBS (dual band simultaneous) solutions (2 LMACs), WCN6750 has a
single LMAC supporting 2G, 5G and 6G bands. It can be operated only
on one band at any given point.

WCN6750 is a PCIe device. Unlike other supported ATH11K PCIe devices
which are directly attached to APSS (Application Processor SubSystem),
WCN6750 is not attached to APSS, it is attached to the WPSS
(Wireless Processor SubSystem) Q6 processor, the FW which runs on the
Q6 processor will enumerate the PCIe device. Since APSS is unaware of
such a device, it has to be registered as a platform device(AHB) to the
kernel for device probing. Like other AHB devices, remoteproc APIs are
used to boot up or shutdown of WCN6750.

WCN6750 uses both AHB and PCIe ATH11K APIs for it's operation.
It uses AHB APIs for device probe and booting of the remote processor.
Once device is booted up, it uses ATH11K PCIe APIs for initialization
and register access. Hence, it is referred as hybrid bus device in
the rest of this series.

Since the chip is enumerated by WPSS Q6, device information like
BAR and BAR size is not known to the APSS processor. A new QMI message
called device info QMI request will be sent to the target for fetching
these details.

STA and AP modes are supported; Basic connectivity and ping are
verified in both the modes.

An important point to note is that though WCN6750 is a PCIe device,
it cannot be attached to any other platform except on Qualcomm
Snapdragon SoCs due to the aforementioned reasons.
