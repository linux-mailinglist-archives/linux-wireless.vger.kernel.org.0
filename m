10 seconds is likely that *something* is wrong (or at least suboptimal),
but IMO, it's not quite at unreasonable levels. But yes, my point was
mainly that it's squishy, and I personally wouldn't want to be the one
running with the lowest CONFIG_DPM_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT out there, given the
known behavior of multiple drivers and the timeout-means-panic behavior.

That seems reasonable.

To be clear, I'm OK with this patch, if we can get a little more
confidence in it (like the timing data and HW info). I *think* 5 vs 10
isn't a big deal here, but I don't have much other than my guess at the
moment.

You probably meant min()?

Yeah, I wondered similarly -- or in reverse, if we could somehow "pat"
the watchdog or prime it with an expected timeout. But AFAICT, neither
such feature exists today.

Yeah, if you made the watchdog just interrupt suspend and dump some
warnings, then the effect would be pretty similar to this patch.

I was just throwing out ideas, but I didn't specifically mean user
space. You provided a few more ideas. Anyway, I was just fishing for
*some* attempt at real-world (and, as-bad-as-you-can-simulate world)
numbers, since that's the point of a timeout like this.

I'll leave it up to y'all (Doug and Pin-Yen) whether you want to provide
the above to provide a little more confidence, or if you want to
reconsider your use of CONFIG_DPM_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT.
